Many traditional agricultural areas were transformed into the urban-rural transitional areas, in which both urban and rural characteristics exist. Non-point source pollution (NPSP) has become a major side effect of urbanization and agricultural production which caused wide public concerns. It is crucial to carry out research on identifying the spatiotemporal variation in NPSP in the urban-rural transitional area (especially in developing countries, e.g., in China), which is a prerequisite for improving water quality and guiding NPSP control efforts. Modeling approaches are great tools to provide quantitative information on NPSP and optimize the best management practices for NPSP control. We reviewed over twenty years of publications on NPSP modeling and applications in urban, rural and its transitional areas. The strengths and limitations of 20 commonly used NPSP models in China were concluded based on a brief introduction and the evolution history. Reporting the strengths and weaknesses of each NPSP model could enhance its utility in practice. In terms of the unique characteristics of urban-rural transitional areas, which are neither strictly urban nor rural, non-point source pollutants are often distinctly different between traditional pollutants from urban and agricultural areas since the great differences in the hydrological processes, and none of existing NPSP models are fully applicable to urban-rural transitional areas. Based on limited NPSP modeling studies in urban-rural transitional areas, the existing research insufficiency were technical and mechanism limitations of the model despite of numerous improvements in the past, concerns about simulation accuracy, limited investigations on new pollutants, and lack of monitoring data. Future development trend and concerns of NPSP models for urban-rural transitional areas were discussed, which could be of great help to the development of NPSP models and their applications in water quality management in the rapid urbanized China. © 2022","China; Non-point source pollution model; Urban-rural transitional area; Urbanization; Water quality","Agriculture; Developing countries; Quality control; Quality management; Rural areas; Water conservation; Water management; Water pollution; Agricultural areas; China; Non-point source pollution model; Nonpoint sources; Nonpoint-source pollution (NPS); Pollution models; Source waters; Urban-rural; Urban-rural transitional area; Urbanization; Water quality; China; developing country; nonpoint source pollution; pollutant; quantitative analysis; review; rural area; simulation; urbanization; water pollution; water quality",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125536561

This study aims to investigate the status of access to energy in rural areas in three West African countries and to identify productive activities that could be developed based on available and accessible energy resources. Thus, surveys were conducted among 2291 rural households, including 640 in Benin, 1001 in Senegal and 650 in Togo. The information was collected using CSPro 6.3 software, cleaned with STATA software and analyzed using Microsoft Office EXCEL 2013 software. The analysis of the findings of the surveys was enriched by typical examples of rural energy enterprises in Mali, Senegal and Nigeria. The findings of the surveys showed that the main source of electricity in rural areas is the non-rechargeable dry cell battery for almost 50% of households and 25% are connected to the grid. The available energy resources reported are solar (89.3%), biomass (73.5%) and agricultural residues (39.5%). The economic activities carried out by households in rural West Africa are essentially agricultural, pastoralism (53.7%) and trade (18.0%). Typical examples of rural enterprises as part of electrification activities which integrate the development of productive activities are presented. This approach allows the populations to have income and cover their electricity consumption bills. This work will continue with the simulation of rural enterprises envisioned in the agriculture and livestock sector in West Africa. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Energy justice; Energy resources; Productive uses of energy; Rural entrepreneurship; West Africa","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Economics; Energy resources; Surveys; Cooking systems; Energy; Energy justices; Productive use of energy; Rural enterprise; Rural entrepreneurship; Rural households; Rural population; Senegal; West Africa; Rural areas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125279795

In order to accurately analyze agricultural GHG emissions, this study constructed a dynamic computable general equilibrium model of Chinese agriculture. We aimed to examine the trends and structure of agricultural GHG emissions, and grain production in China. Results show that (i) China's agricultural CO2 emissions will increase from 47.77 MtC in 2008 to 239.99 MtC in 2050. The input of agricultural materials is the primary source for this rise. (ii) Non-CO2 GHG emissions contribute the most to agricultural GHG, which will reach 2214.55 MtC in 2050. (iii) The total agricultural GHG emissions in China will maintain an overall upward trend from 2008 to 2050, increasing from 220 MtC in 2008–2413.64 MtC in 2050 with an average annual growth rate of 5.87%. (iv) GHG emissions from grain production will reach 919.09 MtC by the year 2050. GHG emissions per grain production and emissions per area will increase to 343.81 kgC/t, and 4.46 tC/ha by the year of 2050, respectively. These findings carry several policy implications to China's agriculture low-carbon development, such as improve the agricultural materials utilization efficiency, optimize manure management and treatment, and promote organic planting technology. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Dynamic CGE; Food production; Greenhouse gas emissions","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Fertilizers; Grain (agricultural product); Greenhouse gases; Growth rate; Public policy; Agricultural greenhouse; Agricultural sector; Computable general equilibrium; Dynamic CGE; Dynamic computable general equilibrium models; Equilibrium simulations; Food production; Global issues; Grain production; Greenhouse gas emissions; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125730577

This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate the farmer behavior under changing physical and institutional environments in a case study of Miyun Reservoir watershed, China. The ABM model simulates the complex adaptive systems of agricultural water users under an agricultural water-saving compensation policy. The model we developed in this study characterizes agents' sensitivity, learning capability, and information radius, which impacts agricultural income and water consumption of a household. By applying this model to a local ‘paddy to dryland’ subsidy policy program aiming at reshaping the agricultural water-saving behavior, the results show that this policy program reduces agricultural water consumption while also reducing household agricultural income. The policy depends on administrative intervention and financial subsidies at first to ensure compliance and gradually shape household behavior in the long run. And we also propose a suitable subsidy range of 250–350 yuan for this policy program in the long run. The model we built can help to understand agricultural water use adaptation to both anthropogenic and environmental interventions. This research also contributes to the coupled natural and human systems study with the bottom-up agent-based model, and the empirical case study provides solid policy implications for the agricultural water use allocation and adaptative management at the watershed scale. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","ABM; Agricultural water user; ODD protocol; Policy assessment","Agriculture; Behavioral research; Computational methods; Public policy; Reservoirs (water); Simulation platform; Water conservation; Watersheds; Agent-based model; Agricultural water; Agricultural water use; Agricultural water user; Bottom up; ODD protocol; Policy assessment; Water consumption; Water users; Water-saving; Autonomous agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125507311

Assessments of salinity dynamics and sustainability indicators under alternative agricultural practices are needed to identify the right combination of practices that improve sustainability while minimizing land and environmental degradation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the potential of conservation agriculture (CA)-based practices, water-saving irrigation, water quality, and nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates for improving the sustainability of rice-wheat (RWS) and cotton-wheat (CWS) systems in salt-affected irrigated drylands. METHODS: The study included mixed-method approaches of two years of field experiments, soil profile and groundwater salinity simulation using Hydrus-1D model, and multi-criteria trade-off analysis for the holistic assessment of alternative innovations in RWS and CWS. The treatments in experiments were composed of a combination of CA-based practices, water-saving irrigation and N rates. Fourteen sustainability indicators computed from experiments and simulation were compared to evaluate the sustainability of those cropping systems and to reveal the potential of those practices for improving sustainability. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the initial conditions, the soil salinity decreased in both cropping systems, while the reduction rate was much higher in RWS than CWS (by 28%). In RWS, the conventional treatment had the lowest salinity level, while in CWS, CA (permeant bed + residue retention) had the lowest. RWS raised the groundwater table by 25% compared to CWS. The long-term scenario analysis with Hydrus-1D demonstrated that, with increased irrigation water salinity and soil evaporation rates, soil profile salinity increases by 78% in RWS and 66% in CWS. RWS had a higher net profit (+81%) and soil organic carbon (SOC) (-15%), but lower water productivity (WP) (−147%), nitrogen, and energy use efficiency (EUE) (−46%) than CWS. The CA-based practices in CWS improved sustainability indicators with higher yield and net profit (+20%), WP (+26%), SOC (+456%), and EUE (36%) with decreased soil salinity than in the conventional system. SIGNIFICANCE: The study attempts to assess the effectiveness of resource conservation technologies such as choice of crop species and cropping systems, and tillage and water and fertilizer management practices for improving sustainability. This study showed the significance of agronomic, soil, and water management practices for minimizing soil salinity. Further, the findings from this study strongly demonstrated the role of CA in sustainable agricultural production particularly under CWS in salt-affected irrigated dryland. © 2022 The Authors","Economic and environmental sustainability; Energy use efficiency; Hydrus-1D; Land degradation; Soil health","agricultural production; conservation tillage; cropping practice; irrigation system; salinity; soil profile; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124666927

Farmers must use the MWQP to ascertain a geometric mean (GM) of ≤126 CFU/100 mL and statistical threshold value (STV) of ≤410 CFU/100 mL of generic Escherichia coli. Farmers are responsible for collecting samples and paying for testing, incurring a financial and time burden. To determine if testing frequency can be reduced without compromising accuracy, water samples (n = 279) were collected from twelve sites in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region from 2016 to 2018 comprising tidal brackish river, non-tidal fresh river, pond, vegetable processing, and reclaimed water. The GM and STV were calculated for all sites and water types using all samples, and for multiple sub-samples of <20 from each site and water type. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine the proportion of sub-sample sizes that yielded the same determination as the entire sample size of PSR standard compliance. Four sites, two pond and two reclaimed water sites, complied with PSR GM and STV requirements when using the entire sample set. When a water source's calculated GM and STV using the entire sample set hovered close to the PSR thresholds, sub-sample sizes approached the recommended 20 samples to reach a congruent compliance determination. However, 99% agreement was obtained with a sub-sample of five when the absolute difference between the GM and STV from total samples and the PSR thresholds was ≥2.6 and 4.5 log CFU/100 mL E. coli, respectively. These findings suggest that under certain conditions the MWQP may be generated with well below 20 samples, reducing the economic burden on farmers while still maintaining a representative MWQP. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Agricultural water; E. coli; Food safety modernization act; Geometric mean; Irrigation water testing; Statistical threshold value","brackish water; fresh water; lake water; river water; water; food safety; irrigation; modernization; sampling; water quality; Article; controlled study; environmental policy; Escherichia coli; food processing; food safety; irrigation (agriculture); nonhuman; pond; river; standard; United States; vegetable; water monitoring; water quality; water sampling; water supply; Argentina; Atlantic Ocean; Monaco; Monte; Monte Carlo; Escherichia coli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120752116

Historical maps contain a wealth of forest related information and can provide first-hand data for studying the changes in FC over a long time period. Taking the reconstruction of FC in Taiwan Province from 1910–2010 as the research object, we used map extraction and mining methods to extract forest distribution information from historical forest thematic survey maps, topographic and land cover maps, and reconstructed the spatiotemporal patterns of FC in Taiwan from 1910–2010. The results show that: first, the relative bias of the FC area extracted from the historical maps of Taiwan was below 8%, meaning the FC information contained in maps is highly accurate. Second, the FC of Taiwan has generally declined in the past 100 years. From 1910–2010, the forest area declined from 2.62×106 ha to 2.47×106 ha, with relatively obvious forest reduction having occurred. In stages, the forest area of Taiwan decreased by 26.39×104 ha from 1910 to 1950; and increased by 10.53×104 ha during the period 1950–2010. Forest reduction was obvious during the Japanese occupation period, while forest increase was remarkable during the Kuomintang period. Third, during the study period, the total area of patches maintained as forests was 2.17×106 ha with little change in the overall pattern, and forests were mainly distributed in the mountain regions. The loss of forest mainly occurred in the plains, with expanding forest areas mainly in the mountain regions at high elevations and on steep slopes.

On the other hand, time/delay-sensitive and real-time applications cannot be processed in the cloud due to high latency and energy consumption. Hence, a new emerging computing model named fog has emerged to address the mentioned issues and provide a complementary solution. However, Fog nodes provide limited cloud services in minimum delay and energy at the local node, but they cannot process the highly computation-oriented IoT applications. Furthermore, an adaptive cloud-fog integrated framework is proposed to process entire IoT applications and significantly improve the latency, computation cost, load balancing, and energy consumption by accommodating the resources in the form of virtual machine instances. This article exploited the features of two metaheuristic-based techniques Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO) and Partial Swarm Optimization (PSO). We have developed a secure framework to solve the allocation of the IoT services in the cloud-fog environment while minimizing the mentioned influential parameters. The performance of the proposed framework is rigorously evaluated at synthetic datasets and heterogeneity of resources in fog as well as cloud simulation environment. The simulation results proved that the proposed hybrid metaheuristic algorithm outperforms other baseline policies and improves the various influential parameters. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Cloud computing; Cuckoo search optimization; Fog computing; Internet of things; Particle swarm optimization","Balancing; Energy utilization; Fog; Fog computing; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Water management; City management; Cloud environments; Cloud-computing; Cuckoo search optimization; Cuckoo searches; Energy-consumption; Search optimization; Smart agricultures; Smart environment; Transportation management; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125017470

With an increased focus on limiting warming of the global mean temperature to 1.5 °C and 2 °C in climate policy, there is a pressing need to understand changes in these compound events under the two warming levels. In this study, we analyze changes in the frequency of CDWEs and CWWEs in a 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming world based on climate simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Using the 25th/75th and 75th/75th percentile of precipitation and temperature as thresholds to define the two compound events, results show that the global average increase in CDWEs is 105% and 142% from the present period to 1.5 °C warming and 2 °C warming, respectively. For CWWEs, the global average increase is 170% and 260% for 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming, respectively. We further assess changes in the two compound events by the end of the 21st century (i.e., 2081–2100) and find an average increase of 211% and 574% in the frequency of CDWEs and CWWEs, respectively.

Besides the environmental goals to be reached by the single EU member state, these directives clearly underline the role of experts in supporting planners and public authorities to fulfil these objectives. This work presents a new web-based, freely-available dynamical tool, named the pesticide fate tool, developed within the geospatial Decision Support system (DSS), LandSupport, for the assessment of groundwater vulnerability, specific for type of pollutant. The tool is based on the extended transfer function model, specifically expanded to consider the transport of reactive solutes, such as pesticides. The work describes the tool implementation for three case studies, with different spatial scales and pedo-climatic conditions: Valle Telesina, IT, Marchfeld, AT, and Zala County, HU. Principal inputs of the tool are: soil physical and hydrological properties, climate, groundwater table depth, type of crops and related pesticides. Results of the model are shown through the LandSupport GUI both as coloured maps, representing the relative concentration of pesticide at the arrival to the water table at the end of the simulation period, and as cumulative charts of the solute arrival at the depth of interest. The three case studies are shown as examples of application of the LandSupport DSS in supporting the Water and Pesticides directives, demonstrating that it represents a valuable instrument for public authorities, environmental planners, as well as agricultural extension services. For example, large differences are shown by soils in filtering the tetraconazole (99.9% vs 76%), a fungicide used in viticulture, or different percentage of arrival (0.32% and 0,01%) to the groundwater table are shown for two herbicides (Tribenuron and Florasulam) largely used to control annual dicotyledonous weeds. © 2021 The Authors","Groundwater specific vulnerability assessment; LandSupport; Pesticide fate tool; TFM-ext model","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Environmental regulations; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Pesticides; Planning; Water conservation; Case-studies; Geo-spatial; Groundwater specific vulnerability assessment; Groundwater vulnerability assessments; Landsupport; Pesticide fate tool; Pesticide fates; Public authorities; TFM-ext model; Vulnerability assessments; Groundwater; ground water; pesticide; pesticide; chemical pollutant; decision support system; environmental assessment; environmental fate; groundwater pollution; groundwater resource; herbicide; modeling; nonpoint source pollution; vulnerability; Article; climate change; concentration (parameter); decision support system; environmental impact; pollutant; soil; agriculture; environmental monitoring; water pollutant; Agriculture; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Pesticides; Soil; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116872360

With the limitation of resources and costs, determining priority control factor is critical for managing soil TM pollution. To explore the pollution characteristics, source apportionment, and human health risk of TMs, a total of 209 surface soil samples were collected from Anqing City, China. Results showed that all the average values of TM concentration, except for Cr, were higher than their corresponding background value. Using a Positive matrix factorization model coupled with Correlation analysis, four sources (including agricultural sources, atmospheric deposition sources, industrial sources, and natural sources) were identified as the determinants for the accumulation of soil TMs, with the contribution rates of 12.4%, 8.1%, 64.1%, and 15.4%, respectively. The assessment of probabilistic health risks revealed that Non- carcinogenic risks of all populations were acceptable (HI < 1), while Carcinogenic risks were all at a high level (TCR > 10E-04). Agricultural pollution and As were identified as priority control factors, according to the analysis results of the relationship among TMs, pollution sources and health risks.

The vision targets to raise non-oil export from 16% to 50% of non-oil GDP by 2030. Achieving this, in addition to other goals, necessitates a better understanding of the non-oil export relationship with its determinants. However, we are not aware of a study that estimates the impacts of the determinants on Saudi non-oil exports covering the recent years of reforms and low oil prices and that conducts simulations for future. The purpose of this study is to develop an econometric modeling framework for Saudi non-oil export that can enhance informing the policymaking process through empirical estimations and simulations. For estimations, we applied cointegration and equilibrium correction methodology to the annual data for the period 1983–2018. Results show that Middle Eastern and North African countries’ GDP, as a measure of foreign income, and Saudi Arabia’s non-oil GDP, as a measure of production capacity, have statistically significant positive effects on Saudi non-oil exports in the long run. The real effective exchange rate (REER), as a measure of competi-tiveness, also exerts a positive effect in the long run if it depreciates and vice versa. Furthermore, our findings support the Export-led growth concept, which articulates that export can be an engine of economic growth and does not support the Dutch disease concept, which highlights the conse-quences of the resource sector for the non-resource tradable sector for Saudi Arabia. Macroecono-metric model-based simulations conducted up to 2030 reveal out that the Saudi non-oil export is more responsive to the changes in REER than any other determinants. The simulation results also show that non-oil manufacturing makes a three times larger contribution to the future expansion of non-oil exports than agriculture. Moreover, the simulations discover that finance, insurance, and other business services, as well as transport and communication play an important role in improving the Saudi non-oil export performance in the coming decade. The key policy recommendation is that measures should be implemented in a coordinated and balanced way to achieve non-oil exports and other targets of the Vision. © 2022 by the authors.

Normally, Romanian rural localities should show significant differences from one development region to another, being influenced by a number of factors (geographical positioning, the influence of agriculture in the economy, etc.). In this sense, data were collected from the town halls of the localities from Calarasi and Timis counties. The analyzed data were processed by the linear regression method, and the estimation of the evolution of the population was determined using the Vensim simulation program. The paper identifies a pattern in rural localities in Romania that hinders their development, reflected by various socio-economic indicators available in the analyzed localities. The main factor that can change this pattern in rural localities is the influence of local and national decision-makers, who can encourage investment in these areas either through the development of local and national infrastructure or through fiscal measures that encourage the development of quality non-agricultural activities that can generate financial resources and jobs at the local level. Moreover, it is not only the low number of non-agricultural activities that is causing the poor development of rural areas, but rather the low number of economic operators in general and the quality of these types of activities, which in most cases do not have the capacity to create new jobs. © 2022 by the authors.

Using the future land use simulation model, LU was projected up till 2060, after which logistic regression analysis took place to find the most significant driver. Results found that LUC within the baseline scenario and the ones chosen by stakeholders were very different, however concluded that Paddy field extent would decrease in the future to be replaced by more drought resilient agriculture; Perennials & Orchards and Field Crops. Outcomes from future scenarios propose that future LUC was driven by environment spatial factors such as elevation and climate, not soil suitability. With, first hand interviews suggesting it is indirect external factors such as, crop price that drive LUC.

Based on the application of blockchain in an agricultural scenario, an evolutionary game model made up of governments, telecom operators, and agricultural enterprises was established to analyze the model’s equilibrium stability and evolutionary stable strategy. Then, numerical simulation was carried out to study the influence of the initial green level, equipment deployment cost, technology operation cost, and other core factors on the tripartite evolution behaviour. The results show that each factor influences the behaviour of a third party in different ways. Finally, according to the simulation results, this paper puts forward practical suggestions, explores the long-term impact of the application cost and sustainable income of blockchain technology on cooperation, and provides new ideas for the governance of China’s traditional fields from the perspective of new technology application. © 2022 by the authors.

Rowan College of Engineering, Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ  08028, United States","In recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has become an attractive method to recognize and localize plant species in unstructured agricultural environments. However, developed systems suffer from unoptimized combinations of the CNN model, computer hardware, camera configuration, and travel velocity to prevent missed detections. Missed detection occurs if the camera does not capture a plant due to slow inferencing speed or fast travel velocity. Furthermore, modularity was less focused on Machine Vision System (MVS) development. However, having a modular MVS can reduce the effort in development as it will allow scalability and reusability. This study proposes the derived parameter, called overlapping rate (ro ), or the ratio of the camera field of view (S) and inferencing speed ( f ps) to the travel velocity (⇀v ) to theoretically predict the plant detection rate (rd ) of an MVS and aid in developing a CNN-based vision module. Using performance from existing MVS, the values of ro at different combinations of inferencing speeds (2.4 to 22 fps) and travel velocity (0.1 to 2.5 m/s) at 0.5 m field of view were calculated. The results showed that missed detections occurred when ro was less than 1. Comparing the theoretical detection rate (rd,th ) to the simulated detection rate (rd,sim ) showed that rd,th had a 20% margin of error in predicting plant detection rate at very low travel distances (&lt;1 m), but there was no margin of error when travel distance was sufficient to complete a detection pattern cycle (≥10 m). The simulation results also showed that increasing S or having multiple vision modules reduced missed detection by increasing the allowable⇀vmax . This number of needed vision modules was equal to rounding up the inverse of ro . Finally, a vision module that utilized SSD MobileNetV2 with an average effective inferencing speed of 16 fps was simulated, developed, and tested. Results showed that the rd,th and rd,sim had no margin of error in predicting ractual of the vision module at the tested travel velocities (0.1 to 0.3 m/s). Thus, the results of this study showed that ro can be used to predict rd and optimize the design of a CNN-based vision-equipped robot for plant detections in agricultural field operations with no margin of error at sufficient travel distance. © 2022 by the authors.

It is motivated by practical situations faced by the agricultural stage of sugarcane mills. Due to the frequent changes in the locations of harvest fronts, the emergency calls for tire repair also change their locations over time, and managers should determine the appropriate number and locations of servers and their dispatch policies. This approach is applied to a case study conducted in the tire repair emergency services of a sugarcane mill. A simulation model is also developed to crosscheck the validity of this approach. This work aims at analyzing and highlighting the importance of considering time-dependent changes in arrival rates at different regions of the system.

In this study, the area around an abandoned electronic waste dismantling center in China was selected as the research area. The probabilistic health risks caused by heavy metals were evaluated by the Monte Carlo simulation. Random forest, partial least squares regression, and generalized linear models were utilized to predict heavy metal distributions and identify the potential driving factors affecting heavy metal accumulation in soil. The relationships of spatial variation between the heavy metal contents and environmental variables were further visualized. The results revealed that cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) were the primary soil pollutants in the study area and caused high ecological risks. The probabilistic health risk assessment indicated that the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks for all populations were acceptable. However, children are more susceptible to heavy metal soil contamination than adults. The sensitivity analyses indicated that the total contents of soil heavy metals and soil ingestion rate were the dominant factors affecting human health. The random forest model, with R2 values of 0.41, 0.65, 0.57, 0.71, and 0.58 for Cd, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Pb, respectively, predicted the heavy metal concentrations better than the other two models. The distance to the nearest industrial enterprise, industrial output, and agricultural chemical input were the main factors affecting Cd, Cu, Zn, and Pb accumulations in the soil, and soil pH and soil parent material were the primary factors influencing Ni accumulation in the soil. The visualization results of the geographically weighted regression model showed a significant relationship between soil heavy metal contents and industrial activity level.

In this study, we present how catchment management strategies benefit from a coordinated implementation of measures that are based on understanding key drivers of pollution. We develop a modelling approach that integrates environmental impacts, human activities, and management measures as three hierarchical levels. We present a catchment water management model (CatchWat) that achieves all three hierarchical levels and is applied to the Cherwell Catchment, UK. CatchWat simulations are evaluated against observed river flow and pollutant data including suspended solids, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. We compare three competing hypotheses, or framings, of the catchment representation (integrated, urban-only, and rural-only framings) to test the impacts of model boundaries on river water quality modelling. Scenarios are formulated to simulate separate, combined and coordinated implementation of fertiliser application reduction and enhanced wastewater treatment. Results show that models must represent both urban and rural pollution emissions to accurately estimate river quality. Agricultural activities are found to drive river quality in wet periods because runoff is the main pathway for rural pollutants. Meanwhile, urban activities are the key source of pollution in dry periods because effluent constitutes a larger percentage of river flow during this time. Based on this understanding, we identify a coordinated management strategy that implements fertiliser reduction measures to improve river quality during wet periods and enhanced wastewater treatment to improve river quality during dry periods. The coordinated strategy performs comparably to the combined strategy but with higher overall efficiency. This study emphasises the importance of systems boundaries in integrated water quality modelling and simulating the mechanisms of seasonal water quality behaviour. Our key recommendation is that incorporating these mechanisms is required to develop coordinated strategies for river water quality management, that can ultimately lead to more efficient and sustainable catchment management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Integrated catchment management; Lumped hydrological modelling; Pollution control; Urban-rural water cycle; Water quality modelling; Water systems boundaries","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Catchments; Digital storage; Drought; Effluents; Fertilizers; Hierarchical systems; Quality control; Quality management; River pollution; Runoff; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water pollution control; Water quality; Hydrological models; Integrated catchment managements; Lumped hydrological modeling; Rural waters; System boundary; Urban-rural; Urban-rural water cycle; Water cycle; Water quality modelling; Water system; Water system boundary; Rivers; fertilizer; nitrogen; phosphorus; river water; catchment; environmental impact; hierarchical system; integrated approach; pollution control; pollution monitoring; river flow; river management; runoff; rural area; strategic approach; urban area; wastewater treatment; water management; water quality; agricultural procedures; Article; catchment area (hydrology); concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental monitoring; rainy season; river; rural area; seasonal variation; urban area; waste water management; water flow; water management; water monitoring; water pollution; water quality; agriculture; human; system analysis; water pollutant; Cherwell River; England; United Kingdom; Agriculture; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Rivers; Systems Integration; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116020454

This paper analyses the market effects of this uneven implementation of an agricultural policy instrument along the sugar supply chain, focusing in particular on changes in sugar production in individual EU Member States. In addition to previous literature, the effects on the production of competing crops to sugar beet are also presented. Moreover, the effects of coupled support are investigated under two different yield levels to account for yield uncertainties arising from an application ban on certain insecticides that came into force in the EU in 2018. The simulation was carried out using the partial equilibrium model AGMEMOD. Results suggest that the market-distorting effect of coupled support for sugar beet remains limited and tends to be higher under an optimistic yield development. Assuming unchanged yield growth, the simulated increase in sugar production of EU countries providing coupled support totals 258,000 tonnes of sugar (+5.7%), while sugar production in EU countries without coupled payments declines by only 21,000 tonnes (−0.2%) resulting in an overall increase in EU sugar production of 236,000 tonnes (+1.3%). Despite these rather limited market-distorting effects, providing coupled support to sugar beet cannot be supported from an economic point of view because it contradicts the objective of a stronger market-orientation of EU agricultural production. © 2021 The Authors.

In particular, when used to simulate man-managed systems, they allow considering human behavioural aspects within the modelling framework. On the other hand, environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has become an acknowledged tool in research, industry and policy to assess systems’ environmental sustainability. More recently, LCA is being applied to assess the potential environmental impacts of large scale policy actions (e.g., actions to combat climate change). This paper describes the application of a coupled ABM-LCA model to simulate cropping activities in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The ABM considers farmers’ proneness to risk, which was assessed via a naïve Bayesian model trained with the results of a survey distributed to the farmers of the study region. The goal of the study is to assess the effects of the agents’ interactions, that can take place in a farmers’ social network, on the agricultural activities. Geographic Information System (GIS) information, national statistics and naïve Bayesian model are used to parameterize agents’ behaviour and interaction rules. We believe such assessment is necessary for the successful design of public adaptation strategies and subsidy schemes since governmental adaptation actions are needed to reduce emissions due to agricultural activities. Two scenarios (with different levels of farmers’ environmental awareness) were simulated. The results show that the mean and variance of the distribution of farmers’ environmental awareness change due to the effect of the interactions and, as a consequence, farmers’ long-term decisions concerning agricultural activities are affected. This is reflected in the environmental impacts generated by such activities. © 2021","Agent-based modelling; Farm management; Green consciousness; Life cycle assessment; Risk aversion; Social interaction","Agriculture; Bayesian networks; Behavioral research; Biological systems; Climate change; Complex networks; Computational methods; Decision making; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Risk assessment; Simulation platform; Sustainable development; Agent interaction; Agent-based model; Agricultural activities; Bayesian modelling; Environmental awareness; Farm management; Green consciousness; Naive Bayesian; Risk aversion; Social interactions; Autonomous agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121116658

By accounting for the emissions from China's eight sectors over the past 23 years, this study examines the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis for the eight sectors using both regression analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. We found that seven out of the eight sectors are expected to reach their peak emissions before 2040, despite continued economic growth. Specifically, emissions from the Agriculture, Building, Manufacturing, Others, and Transportation sectors are highly likely to peak before 2030, while those from the Electricity and Mining sectors may peak after 2030.

This permits the analysis of the impact of trade policies in the presence of global upstream and downstream linkages through a counterfactual analysis. The analysis goes beyond previous studies by focusing on member countries' agricultural and food integration in regional and global value chains through backward and forward linkages. Our simulation results suggest that the agreement could have a significant impact on trade patterns in terms of value-added structure and extra- or intra-regional destinations. The reduction in trade costs within the region has a higher incidence on agriculture and food backward intra-regional integration than on forward participation, but this pattern varies substantially across countries.

Prairie strips have been demonstrated as an effective conservation practice to improve environmental quality in agroecosystems. This research aims to assess prairie strips’ potential for reducing the transport of LAB and ARGs in runoff after litter application. Plot-scale rainfall simulations were performed using a replicated block design, with soil and surface runoff samples taken during the rainfall event. Microbial taxa and ARGs were characterized in the litter, soil, and water samples. In plots with litter application, LAB and ARGs were mainly detected in runoff, with very low detection in soils. Detection of ARGs in runoff, irrespective of strip installations, is consistent with previous observations of litter as a source of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) risks. The effectiveness of prairie strips to remove LAB and ARGs varied. In two of the three prairie strip plots, fewer AMR indicators were detected relative to control plots, suggesting that the prairie strips can potentially reduce these risks. In one plot, which was also associated with increased flow rate, we observed increased AMR indicators despite the installation of a prairie strip. Our observations highlight the need to prioritize understanding of soil properties even within the same site. Although we show that prairie strips can potentially reduce AMR risks, further research is needed to better understand the influence of rainfall timing, soil, and litter characteristics. © 2022 The Authors.",,"Laboratories; Microorganisms; Rain; Runoff; Soils; Agricultural productions; Agro-ecosystems; Antibiotic resistance genes; Antimicrobial resistances; Associated bacteria; Bacteria resistance; Conservation practices; Environmental quality; Potential sources; Poultry litter; Agriculture",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125943781

Supply-side approaches for reducing emissions from agriculture rely on emissions-saving technological change and environmental protection of carbon-rich areas. This study investigates how productivity policies, in the form of higher agricultural research and development (R&D) spending, might affect GHG emissions from agriculture, and compares this to environmental policies that restrict agricultural land use or production practices that may cause environmental harm. Using simulations from a global economic model, we project outcomes in 2050 from a set of policy scenarios involving R&D and environmental policies, and combinations of the two. Outcomes of interest are net global GHG emissions, land use, agricultural production, food prices, the prevalence of food insecurity, and policy cost. We find that at the global level, more R&D spending to accelerate productivity growth reduces GHG emissions from land use change, but not as effectively as targeted environmental policies. However, accelerated productivity growth reduces the emissions intensity of agricultural production and, by lowering land rents, also reduces the cost of the environmental policy. Moreover, higher levels of productivity lower agricultural GHG emissions permanently, and by lowering global food prices, generally improve global food security. A policy scenario that is patterned after the EU Green Deal finds that policies that restrict agricultural factor inputs in order to reduce local environmental costs may, at the global level, increase agricultural GHG emissions and worsen food insecurity. These consequences could be avoided with higher EU R&D spending to accelerate agricultural productivity growth that is either factor neutral or biased toward saving production factors associated with negative environmental externalities. © 2022 Agricultural & Applied Economics Association.

This paper first constructed a tripartite evolutionary game model concerning local governments, higher polluting farms, and consumers, all of which participate in the reduction of nitrogen pollution in the river basin. Secondly, the evolution process of evolutionary stability strategy (ESS) and the impact of critical parameters on the strategies of the three stakeholders were analyzed through numerical simulation. The results demonstrated that (1) six ESSs of the system are determined, only (1, 0, 1) is regarded as the most ideal ESS: regulation by local governments, higher polluting farms adopting not purchasing emission rights, and consumers purchasing green agricultural products. (2) The regulation strategy of local governments depends on comparing political losses with the sum of emission reduction subsidies and the supervision cost. (3) The marginal abatement costs, the price of nitrogen emission permits, nitrogen use efficiency, and the subsidy standard for unit emission reduction are the main factors that affect the ESS of higher polluting farms. (4) The ESS of consumers is significantly affected by low-nitrogen preference, government subsidies, and nitrogen use efficiency. This study suggests that the government should strengthen the supervision of the watershed environment from the aspects of improving the market mechanism of nitrogen trading, establishing a dynamic monitoring system, and innovating a subsidy mechanism. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Government regulation; Non-point source nitrogen pollution; Tripartite evolutionary game; Watershed",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123936504

Levels of CPF and MCP were assessed in the paddy field from the edible foot tissue of apple snail (Pila globosa) exposed to low (1.5 ml l−1 water) and high (2.5 ml l−1 water) agricultural doses for 48 h to determine human health risk associated with consumption of tissue. CPF and MCP were extracted by liquid–liquid extraction and analysed by QuEChERS method using GC–MS/MS. For low and high concentrations of CPF exposure, the pesticide residue levels in the paddy field water ranged from 4.43 to 1.08 and 5.13 to 1.53 µg l−1, respectively, whereas, for low and high concentrations of MCP exposure, the residue levels in water ranged from 16.43 to 5.78 and 31.41 to 9. 27 µg l−1, respectively, for 3–48 h.

Besides being a center of national activity in the industrial domain, this city was also named a special economic zone (SEZ). LUC is classified from satellite imagery from Landsat 5 (1998 and 2009) and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (2018), with six LUC categories: built-up area, vegetation, agriculture, bareland, wetland, and waterbody. There are three LUC maps produced. LSTs were also identified using the same imagery, resulting in 1998, 2009 and 2018 LST maps. The classification results show that the built-up area increased significantly. Monte Carlo Simulation was carried out to investigate the relationship between LUC and LST changes. From 1998 to 2009, the built-up area increased from 2025 ha to 3060.85 ha, while from 2009 to 2018, it increased from 3060.85 to 3783.63 ha. The LST in 1998 ranged from 23.28 to 33.21 °C, in 2009 from 23.28 to 35.48 °C, while in 2018 it ranged between 28.51 and 35.05 °C.

In addition, a Tingjiang River water resources allocation and eco‐compensation mechanism model based on the interval fuzzy two‐stage (IFTS) optimization method was also constructed. The objec-tive functions of both models were to maximize the economic benefits of the Tingjiang River. The available water resources in the basin, the water environmental quality requirements, and regional development requirements were used as constraints, and under the five hydrological scenarios of extreme dryness, dryness, normal flow, abundance, and extreme abundance, the water resources allocation plan of various sectors (industry, municipal, agriculture, and ecology) in the Tingjiang River was optimized, and an eco‐compensation mechanism was developed. In this work, the uncertainty of the maximum available water resources in each region and the whole basin was con-sidered. If the maximum available water resources were too high, it would lead to a large waste of water resources, whereas if the maximum available water resources were too low, regional economic development would be limited. Therefore, the above two parameters were set as fuzzy parameters in the optimization model construction in this work. The simulation results from the IFTS model showed that the amount of water available in the river basin directly affects the water usage by various departments, thereby affecting the economic benefits of the river basin and the amount of eco‐compensation paid by the downstream areas. The average economic benefit of the Tingjiang River after the optimization of the IFTS model simulation was [3868.51, 5748.99] × 108 CNY, which is an increase of [1.67%, 51.9%] compared to the economic benefit of the basin announced by the government in 2018. Compared to the ITS model, the economic benefit interval of the five hydrological scenarios of extreme dryness, dryness, normal flow, abundance, and extreme abundance was reduced by 28.54%, 44.9%, 31.49%, 40.37%, and 36.43%, respectively, which can improve the economic benefits of the basin and provide more accurate decision‐making schemes. In addition, the IFTS simulation showed that the eco‐compensation quota paid by downstream Guangdong Province to upstream Fujian Province is [28,116.4, 30,738.6] × 104 CNY, which is a reduction of [8461.404, 110,836] × 104 CNY compared to the 2018 compensation scheme of the government. Compared to the ITS model, the range of eco‐compensation values was observed to increase by 9.94%, 54.81%, 15.85%, 50.31%, and 82.90%, respectively, under the five hydrological scenarios, which re-duces the burden of ecological expenditure downstream and provides a broader decision‐making space for decision‐makers and thus enables improved decision‐making efficiency. At the same time, after the optimization of the IFTS model, the additional water consumption of the second stage of the Tingjiang River during the extremely dry year decreased by 62.11% compared to the results of the ITS model. The additional water consumption of the industrial sector decreased by 68.39%, the municipal sector decreased by 59.27%, and in the first phase of water resources allocation for 14 districts and counties in the Tingjiang River, industrial and municipal sectors are the main two sec-tors. After introducing the fuzzy method into the IFTS model, the difference in the water consumption by these two sectors in the basin under different hydrological scenarios can be alleviated, and the waste of water resources caused by too low water allocation or excessive water allocation can be avoided. The national and local (the downstream region) eco‐compensation quotas can be indi-rectly reduced, and the risk of water resources allocation and eco‐compensation decision‐making in the basin can be effectively reduced. © 2021 by the authors.

Empirical parameter estimates are used to simulate a change in energy pricing policy from existing decreasing block rate structures to a revenue-neutral uniform marginal price. The simulation results reveal that, on average, uniform energy pricing leads to an 11% decrease in groundwater use than would occur under a decreasing block rate pricing regime. However, a transition to uniform energy pricing diminishes short-run producer welfare.

Kenya addresses this concern with a noteworthy policy mix, aiming at giving to the agricultural sector a leading task in improving food security. This paper evaluates the impacts on food security of expanding fertilizer capacities in Kenya, combined with a set of additional policy changes targeting fertilizer use. In a top-down analysis, a specific Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is linked with a microsimulation approach. Scenarios present overall positive effects on key food security aggregates. The same is true for welfare. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity of households across and within regions suggests that improving input productivity through better market access and service extension are critical to reducing possible discrepancies across farmers, households and regions. The paper concludes on the need for a sound policy mix since increasing fertilizer production alone is not enough to enhance food security evenly. Among accompanying measures, intensifying extension services are essential especially for smallholders in their acquisition of better knowledge on the use of agricultural inputs. © European Union 2020.

Agriculture being a predominant global land use, C sequestration under different agro-ecosystems through appropriate management practices is an important option to combat the anthropogenic climate change. Conservation tillage along with residue management, stubble retention, mulching, organic farming and integrated nutrient management not only facilitates soil C storage but also improves soil health. Change in land-uses and cropping system also impart notable effects on soil C turnover. Biochar application is found effective in augmenting soil C stock and improving soil aggregation. Bioenergy plantations are also effective in sequestering C. Simulation models and remote sensing are innovative tools for predicting and mapping soil C status and identifying site-specific strategic policies to minimize the risk of land degradation and to maintain environmental sustainability. Therefore, the aim of this review is to disseminate ideas regarding current C status, identify researchable priorities and to deliberate pros and cons of agricultural management practices for better implementation of soil C sequestration strategies for mitigating the consequences of climate change. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","agricultural management practices; remote sensing and simulation models; Soil carbon sequestration","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Carbon; Global warming; Land use; Remote sensing; Soils; Sustainable development; Agricultural management practice; Anthropogenic climate changes; Bioenergy plantation; Conservation tillage; Environmental sustainability; Integrated nutrients; Remote sensing techniques; Soil carbon sequestration; Soil conservation; agricultural management; carbon sequestration; global warming; organic farming; remote sensing; agricultural management; article; bioenergy; carbon sequestration; climate change; cropping system; environmental sustainability; human; land use; plantation; remote sensing; simulation; soil aggregation; turnover rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089894162

Soil P saturation leads to P retention being primarily dependent on water volume retention. The water quality and economic feasibility of hydraulic modifications were evaluated at an SDS in the Everglades basin. Modifications included compartmentalizing and increasing the retention volume by raising the discharge control elevation. Measurements showed increase in volumetric retention from 49% to 72% and P retention from 52% to 76%. Model simulations for a 25-year period showed that volume and P retentions could be as high as 92% with modifications, depending on the rainfall distribution. Economic analyses showed that modifications can provide additional water storage at $10/ac-ft ($81/ha-m) and P retention at $14/kg, which is more economical than the respective costs of 103/ac-ft ($835/ha-m) and $355-$909/kg P for the state-funded treatment systems. Basin-wide scale-up showed a potential reduction of 43,000 kg P per year. Modification costs are conservative since we assumed that additional water and P would be retained once every two years due to the occurrence of drier/wetter than normal years. Everglades is facing a multitude of challenges such as the timing and amounts of excess discharges of freshwater and P. We propose a payment for environmental services (PES) approach which lets the state choose the services depending on the specific challenges, such as excess water or P or both. Given the large-scale presence of SDSs or similar features globally, a public-private partnership to modify their hydraulic design can help achieve environmental goals, economically benefitting both the public (buyer) and private landowners (sellers). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural ponds; Best management practices; Nutrient treatment; Payment for environmental services; Stormwater detention; Water storage","Agricultural robots; Cost benefit analysis; Economic analysis; Phosphorus; Quality control; Storms; Water quality; Agricultural pond; Best Management Practise; Nutrient treatments; P retention; Payment for environmental services; Phosphorus retention; Storm water detention; Stormwater systems; Water retention; Water storage; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119002428

However, the regional benefits of these investments and their influence on the conflicting demands among different water dependent stakeholders for intensely irrigated regions remains an open question. Using the Pacific Northwest of the United States as an illustrative region of focus, we show that higher irrigation efficiency has diverse effects across stakeholders that are contingent on many local climatic, institutional and infrastructural factors such as the availability of water storage, the location of hydropower generators, and water rights. These complexities limit simple abstractions of irrigation efficiency as broader policy challenge and are central to its inclusion within the class of “wicked problems”. Additionally, we argue that the widely used rebound effect concept, which implicitly discourages irrigation efficiency supporting policies, should not be assumed to fully capture the nuances of the complex suite of regional impacts that emerge from irrigation efficiency investments. Consequently, the evaluation of irrigation efficiency investments requires a broader framing across a diversity of perspectives. policies and actions that are pluralistic, context-specific, and closely engage various groups of stakeholders in the policymaking process. © 2021","Basin-wide impacts; Climate change; Efficient irrigation systems; Institutions and infrastructures","water; water; adaptive management; climate change; demand analysis; institutional framework; investment; irrigation system; power generation; stakeholder; strategic approach; water storage; agricultural worker; Article; case study; climate change; economic aspect; energy resource; environmental management; food; government; human; hydropower; investment; irrigation (agriculture); labor law; policy; river basin; simulation; stakeholder engagement; United States; water availability; water cycle; water supply; climate change; water supply; Pacific Northwest; United States; Agricultural Irrigation; Climate Change; Farmers; Humans; United States; Water; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115350253

Since scientific determination of fallow scale is the common concern problem in the research field of fallow, it's highly urgent to study what the exact fallow scale threshold is so that scientific basis can be provided to deeply carry out the national strategy of ""Storing Grain in Land"" and expand fallow pilot scheme on a national scale. The superior basis condition of cultivated land has help major grain producing areas play significant roles in ensuring the national food security, while the long-term intensive utilization of cultivated land has also caused land degradation and ecological environment deterioration. By introducing the revising pressure index on cultivated land and ecological balance index, the study aimed to build a model with general applicability to estimate the largest fallow scale of major grain producing areas under both food security and ecological safety constraints, meanwhile an approach of determining the elastic boundary of fallow scale is also presented. Then Jiangsu Province was selected as the empirical area and System Dynamics model was employed to simulate and forecast the variation tendency of the largest fallow scale as well as elastic boundary of fallow scale. The results showed that: 1) during the simulation run from 2007 to 2016, the elastic boundary of fallow scale would shrink from 12.12% in 2007 to 10.16% in 2016, a certain proportion of flexible cultivated land resource can still be held in Jiangsu Province to support the implementation of fallow system when the grain distribution mission was accomplished and the ecology of cultivated land resource was also taken into consideration; 2) during the simulation run from 2017 to 2036, the cultivated land resource in Jiangsu Province would decrease to 446.63×104hm2with the rapid urbanization process and the implementation of land protection measures may have little effect to avoid the over-fast loss of cultivated land. In addition, the condition and environment of fallow would also be broken because of the deterioration of cultivated land resource ecology; 3) during the simulation run from 2017 to 2036, because the sustainability of cultivated land resource and fallow suitability index would both continue to decline over time, the maximum fallow scale and elastic boundary of fallow scale would both decrease over half at the end of the simulation, sustainable use of cultivated land appears to be less optimistic. Taking both food security and ecological safety into consideration, it was suggested to take full advantage of solid foundation of cultivated land resource in major grain producing areas, and implement normalized fallow actively and orderly. Great importance should be attached to the potential ecological security risks of cultivated land resource in major grain producing areas, the early warning index system link up with food security and ecological safety should be built to dynamically adjust the fallow scheme. Besides, the fallow system and other cultivated land protection policies, such as abandoned farmland management, land consolidation and farmland capital construction, should be aligned to make overall plans, so that positive spillover effects can be created in the internal cultivated land protection system and further promote cultivated land ecosystem through the implementation of fallow. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Here we combine national-scale geospatial datasets with hydrologic simulations to compute two metrics representing potential contamination of water supplies from point and nonpoint sources for over a hundred U.S. cities. We reveal enormous diversity in anthropogenic activities across watersheds with corresponding disparities in the potential contamination of drinking water supplies to cities.

In particular, the study attempts to investigate the impact of different fund-allocation criteria on the regional distribution of direct payments. The research employs a simulation method in the form of variant analysis (the “what if” model)—a mathematical method with elements of statistical description, based on the complete dataset. For the purposes of one of the variants, a multi-criteria composite indicator was constructed, including stimulants and destimulants of the level of environmental sustainability of agricultural plant production. The analysis was conducted at the NUTS 2 level (voivodeships). The timeframe of the study covered the period 2010–2019. The data published by Statistics Poland and the Agency for the Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture were used as the source material. The analysis indicated that the 2015 Common Agricultural Policy reform redistributed public funds away from sustainable agricultural management principles. Applying some basic sustainability criteria in order to internalise environmental externalities would lead to a radical redistribution of first-pillar Common Agricultural Policy payments. The paper concludes that a real greening of the European Union’s agricultural policy is a task still to be accomplished. © 2021 by the authors.

However, ES studies at local scales that address the subject from the perspective of farm property are rare. In this paper, we performed the quantification, valuation, and mapping of carbon storage and sequestration of observed (2007–2017) and future LULC (2027) sustainable scenarios at a cattle ranch in Serra da Mantiqueira, in Southeastern Brazil. The aim was to understand how different LULC changes affect the provision of ES and contribute to economic opportunities to the farming sector. Under a GIS-approach, we used remote sensing techniques for LULC mapping, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) for scenario building and carbon assessment, as well as the Sis software suite for forest growth and production simulation. All scenarios contributed to increasing carbon storage and sequestration and provided profitable economic opportunities. The introduction of Eucalyptus trees in livestock and agricultural production systems is an alternative for diversification and income increase, contributing to the balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) from livestock activity and adding value to production. These results are useful to support land use planning and management for both environmental conservation policies and sustainable farming production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon storage and sequestration; Geographic information system (GIS); Land use land cover change (LULCC); Land use planning; Sustainable agriculture; Tropical forest","alternative agriculture; carbon storage; ecosystem service; GIS; land cover; land use planning; mapping method; profitability; remote sensing; software; Brazil; Serra da Mantiqueira; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118795433

The development of the bio-fuel industry has given grain farmers another crop option. Trends towards renewable fuels could also put fuel production at odds with traditional food agriculture, a situation referred to as the “food vs. fuel” debate. This research models profit maximizing farm crop choices as energy crops become a crop option. We develop a simulation to estimate the oil price level where farmers would switch from the production of grain for food over to bio-energy crops. We also investigate consequences associated with this process on the elevator industry. Using a major crop production region in Canada as a template, we estimate that real annual crude oil prices must remain consistently 30% above the (2008) peak oil price before most farmers in the region would switch over to the production of wheat for biofuel. If government biofuel support falls from current levels, a considerably higher oil price would be needed to entice farmers to switch.

Maize yields in the region’s semi-arid agroecosystems are constrained by highly variable rainfall, which may be worsened by climate change. Thus, the Tanzanian government has prioritized agriculture as an adaptation sector in its intended nationally determined contribution, and crop management adjustments as a key investment area in its Agricultural Sector Development Programme. In this study, we investigated how future changes in maize yields under different climate scenarios can be countered by regional adjusted crop management and cultivar adaptation strategies. A crop model was used to simulate maize yields in the Singida region of Tanzania for the baseline period 1980–2012 and under three future climate projections for 2020–2060 and 2061–2099. Adaptation strategies to improve yields were full irrigation, deficit irrigation, mulch and nitrogen addition and another cultivar. According to our model results, increase in temperature is the main driver of future maize yield decline. Increased respiration and phenological development were associated with lower maize yields of 16% in 2020–2060 and 20% in 2061–2099 compared to the 1980–2012 baseline. Surprisingly, none of the management strategies significantly improved yields; however, a different maize variety that was tested as an alternative coping strategy performed better. This study suggests that investment in accessibility of improved varieties and investigation of maize traits that have the potential to perform well in a warmer future are better suited for sustaining maize production in the semi-arid region than adjustments in crop management. © 2021, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate change; Maize; Model; NDC; Tanzania",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115745616

But it remains unclear whether it is possible to increase agricultural and food production without increasing deforestation and associated greenhouse gas emissions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to advance the understanding of landscape-level implications of sustainable intensification of agriculture on forest conservation in Zambia. Sustainable intensification aims to increase agricultural yields and reduce deforestation. Miombo woodlands, a dry forest ecosystem common throughout the region, are the dominant biome in much of Zambia, and they are suitable for the production of charcoal, a commonly used cooking fuel among urban households. METHODS: We used participatory system dynamics modeling to examine the drivers of deforestation in two provinces in Zambia. We modeled four scenarios to examine their effects on reducing deforestation over a 50-year simulation period: (i) an increase in maize yield from adoption of SI practices, and (ii) occasional moderate and severe drought events, (iii) adoption of efficient charcoal cookstoves, and (iv) full electrification. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found no effects of adoption of sustainable intensification practices on agricultural encroachment into forested ecosystems. The clearing of forested land for agriculture was found to be largely driven by the rising demand for wood fuels for cooking and heating, particularly charcoal in urban areas. Charcoal was increasingly dominant as a driver of deforestation in both provinces such that changes in land practices and economic returns to farmers are unlikely to reveal measurable changes in land use. SIGNIFICANCE: The findings have implications for the development of integrated approaches to address the challenges of food and energy insecurity, as well as for national-level policies aimed at climate change mitigation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This study provides a unique and innovative approach to integrating social and biophysical/ecological data through the application of system dynamics modeling. Furthermore, the study contributes to the literature on the environmental implications of agricultural land use and the drivers of deforestation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Deforestation; Land use change; Miombo woodlands; Sustainable intensification; System dynamics modeling; Zambia","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural intensification; agricultural modeling; alternative agriculture; biome; crop yield; deforestation; emission control; greenhouse gas; Zambia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113476003

Results reveal that our melting scenario could moderate the simulated increase in malaria risk over East Africa, due to cooling and drying effects, cause a largest decrease in malaria transmission risk over West Africa and drive malaria emergence in southern Africa associated with a significant southward shift of the African rain-belt.

Here we model the effect of evictions on SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, simulating viral transmission within and among households in a theoretical metropolitan area. We recreate a range of urban epidemic trajectories and project the course of the epidemic under two counterfactual scenarios, one in which a strict moratorium on evictions is in place and enforced, and another in which evictions are allowed to resume at baseline or increased rates. We find, across scenarios, that evictions lead to significant increases in infections. Applying our model to Philadelphia using locally-specific parameters shows that the increase is especially profound in models that consider realistically heterogenous cities in which both evictions and contacts occur more frequently in poorer neighborhoods. Our results provide a basis to assess eviction moratoria and show that policies to stem evictions are a warranted and important component of COVID-19 control. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"disease transmission; epidemic; metropolitan area; neighborhood; policy approach; severe acute respiratory syndrome; unemployment; urban agriculture; urban area; Article; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; health disparity; household; human; infection control; neighborhood; nonhuman; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; urban area; virus transmission; city; communicable disease control; computer simulation; economics; epidemiology; housing; legislation and jurisprudence; pandemic; pathogenicity; Pennsylvania; policy; procedures; statistical model; unemployment; urban population; virology; Pennsylvania; Philadelphia; United States; SARS coronavirus; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; Computer Simulation; COVID-19; Housing; Humans; Models, Statistical; Pandemics; Philadelphia; Policy; SARS-CoV-2; Unemployment; Urban Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104427443

Farmers are both consumers and producers in seed systems and benefit from access to global markets. However, phytosanitary measures and seed purity tests are also needed to maintain seed quality and prevent the spread of costly weeds, pests and diseases, in some countries regulatory controls have been in place since the 1800s. Nevertheless, seed contaminants are internationally implicated in between 7% and 37% of the invasive plant species and many of the agricultural pests and diseases. We assess biosecurity risk across international seed trade networks of forage crops using models of contaminant spread that integrate network connectivity and trade volume. To stochastically model hypothetical contaminants through global seed trade networks, realistic dispersal probabilities were estimated from quarantine weed seed detections and incursions from border security interception data in New Zealand. For our test case we use contaminants linked to the global trade of ryegrass and clover seed. Between 2014 and 2018 only four quarantine weed species (222 species and several genera are on the quarantine schedule) warranting risk mitigation were detected at the border. Quarantine weeds were rare considering that average import volumes were over 190 tonnes for ryegrass and clover, but 105 unregulated contaminant species were allowed in. Ryegrass and clover seed imports each led to one post-border weed incursion response over 20 years. Trade reports revealed complex global seed trade networks spanning >134 (ryegrass) and >110 (clover) countries. Simulations showed contaminants could disperse to as many as 50 (clover) or 80 (ryegrass) countries within 10 time-steps. Risk assessed via network models differed 18% (ryegrass) or 48% (clover) of the time compared to risk assessed on trade volumes. We conclude that biosecurity risk is driven by network position, the number of trading connections and trade volume. Risk mitigation measures could involve the use of more comprehensive lists of regulated species, comprehensive inspection protocols, or the addition of field surveillance at farms where seed is planted. © 2021 Buddenhagen et al.

Two configurations – one supplied with wheat straw only, and the other supplied with wheat straw, barley straw and manure – were identified to meet the energy demands of the farm. Technical feasibility was investigated via simulations run in ECLIPSE, with the two configurations returning overall system efficiencies of 66.8% and 67.1%, respectively. Economic analyses indicated simple payback periods of 9.4 and 11 years, which fall within the expected 20-year lifetime of the project.

By contrasting the model results with theoretical and empirical insights from actual cities, the validity of modeling the formation of residential diffusion on urban edges based on individual gain-maximizing daily travel and residential relocation is explained. The major contribution of the model is that it offers a new perspective on the bottom-up control of residential diffusion on urban edges, with benefits for productive human interactions at the microscale. Specifically, the model experimentally suggests the existence of a trade-off between increasing human interactions, through the introduction of an open hub attracting diverse activities and promotion of interaction around it, as well as the progression of residential diffusion. The model also suggests that the direction of urbanization is the result of collective action, and sustainable urbanization may be achieved through concerted efforts. © 2021 by the authors.

First, we propose a multi-criteria decision-making framework following the Pugh matrix approach for group decision-making. The Monte Carlo simulation is used to check the effects of the perturbations in the criteria weights. Then, we identify the factors behind agricultural resilience and organize them into the three groups (food security, agricultural viability, decent jobs). The expert survey is carried out to elicit the ratings in regard to the expected effects of the policy measures with respect to dimensions of agricultural resilience. The case of Lithuania is considered in the empirical analysis. The existing and newly proposed agricultural policy measures are taken into account.

Using hot spot analysis, we analyzed the totality of Maryland’s CAFOs and meat processing plants and those restricted to the Eastern Shore to assess whether communities of color and/or low socioeconomic status communities disproportionately hosted these types of facilities at the census tract level. We used zero-inflated regression modeling to determine the strength of the associations between environmental justice variables and the location of CAFOs and meatpacking facilities at the State level and on the Eastern Shore. Hot spot analyses demonstrated that CAFO hot spots on the Eastern Shore were located in counties with some of the lowest wealth in the State, including the lowest ranking county—Somerset. Zero-inflated regression models demonstrated that increases in median household income across the state were associated with a 0.04-unit reduction in CAFOs. For every unit increase in the percentage of people of color (POC), there was a 0.02-unit increase in meat processing facilities across the state. The distribution of CAFOs and meat processing plants across Maryland may contribute to poor health outcomes in areas affected by such production, and contribute to health disparities and health inequity. © 2021 by the authors.

PLF comes with many benefits and ensures maximum use of farm resources, thus, enabling control of health status of animals, while potentially mitigating Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Due to the complexity of the decision making processes in the livestock industries, data-driven decision support systems based on not only real-time data but also expert knowledge, help farmers to take actions in support of animal health and better product yield. These decision support systems are typically based on machine learning, statistical analysis, and modeling and simulation tools. Combining expert knowledge with data obtained from sensors minimizes the risk of making poor decisions and helps to assess the impact of different strategies before applying them in reality. In this paper, we highlight the role of data-driven decision support tools in PLF, and provide an extensive overview and categorization of the different data-driven approaches with respect to the relevant livestock farming goals.

The groundwater of this system contains high concentrations of nitrate which is why aquifer system is classified as a groundwater body of poor chemical status under the Water Framework Directive (WFD). We investigated the groundwater age in this aquifer system and compared the nitrate concentrations in groundwater and the nitrogen pressure from agricultural activity with respect to the estimated mean groundwater age. We used a combination of the environmental tracers: chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs: CFC-12, CFC-11, and CFC-113), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), tritium (3H) and noble gases. By applying lumped parameter models, we determined the groundwater age in aquifers at different depths. On comparing the recharge year, historical data on nitrate concentrations in groundwater, and nitrogen pressure from agricultural activity, we found that these elements are closely related. Our investigation was also supported by the results of numerical simulation of the evolution of nitrate concentration in the saturated zone of the aquifer. The decrease in agricultural pressure caused a decrease in the nitrate concentrations in the youngest, shallow, and oxic groundwater. However, the trend of increasing nitrate concentrations in the deeper part of the aquifer can last for many years. Our research supports the thesis that groundwater age is an important criterion for assessing the effectiveness of protection measures taken in groundwater management and implementation of the WFD and Nitrate Directive. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Groundwater age distribution; Modelling; Nitrate concentration trend; Nitrogen pressure; Porous media","Aquifers; Environmental regulations; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Inert gases; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Porous materials; Sulfur hexafluoride; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Agricultural activities; Aquifer systems; Groundwater age distribution; Groundwater ages; Modeling; Nitrate concentration; Nitrate concentration trend; Nitrogen pressure; Porous medium; Water Framework Directives; Agriculture; aquifer; concentration (composition); groundwater; nitrate; nitrogen; numerical model; phreatic zone; simulation; sulfur; tracer; water supply; Croatia; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112850364

In response to this limitation and focusing on a suite of heavy metals identified as priorities for pollution control, the study established a comprehensive pollution control framework using factor identification coupled with spatial agglomeration for agricultural soils in an industrialized part of Zhejiang Province, China. In addition to elucidating the key role of industrial and traffic activities on heavy metal accumulation through implementing a receptor model, specific influencing factors were identified using a random forest model. The distance from the soil sample location to the nearest likely industrial source was the most important factor in determining cadmium and copper concentrations, while distance to the nearest road was more important for lead and zinc pollution. Soil parent materials, pH, organic matter, and clay particle size were the key factors influencing accumulation of arsenic, chromium, and nickel. Spatial auto-correlation between levels of soil metal pollution and industrial agglomeration can enable a more targeted approach to pollution control measures. Overall, the approach and results provide a basis for improved accuracy in source apportionment, and thus improved soil pollution control, at the regional scale. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Heavy metal pollution; Random forest model; Soil pollution control; Source-sink theory; Spatial bivariate cluster","Agglomeration; Agriculture; Decision trees; Machine learning; Particle size; Pollution control; Soil pollution; Soil surveys; Soils; Agricultural soils; Bivariate analysis; Effective tool; Heavy metals pollution; Hot spot; Machine-learning; Random forest modeling; Source apportionment; Source-sink theory; Spatial bivariate cluster; Heavy metals; arsenic; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; heavy metal; iron; lead; nickel; organic matter; zinc; heavy metal; agricultural soil; heavy metal; machine learning; multivariate analysis; soil pollution; soil quality; source apportionment; spatial analysis; Article; bivariate analysis; cell heterogeneity; coupled plasma mass spectrometry; disaster mitigation; electric conductivity; energy consumption; environmental parameters; environmental protection; health hazard; heavy metal poisoning; industrialization; machine learning; mass spectrometry; meteorology; mining; nonhuman; particle size; pH; prediction; simulation; soil acidity; soil pollution; soil pollution control; soil property; solid waste management; structure analysis; synergistic effect; synthesis; China; environmental monitoring; machine learning; pollution; risk assessment; soil; soil pollutant; China; Zhejiang; China; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Machine Learning; Metals, Heavy; Risk Assessment; Soil; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109079073

To date, multiple land uses are experiencing urban construction-related land expansion, population increase, and socioeconomic development. Comprehensive evaluation and understanding of the effect of urban sprawl and its rapid LUCC are of great importance to managing land surface resources for sustainable development. The present research applied remote sensing data, such as Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat-8 Operation Land Imager, on selected images between July and August from 1985 to 2020 with the use of multiple types of software to explore, classify, and analyze the historical and future LUCCs in Baghdad City. Three historical LUCC maps from 1985, 2000, and 2020 were created and analyzed. The result shows that urban construction land expands quickly, and agricultural land and natural vegetation have had a large loss of coverage during the last 35 years. The change analysis derived from previous land use was used as a change direction for future simulation, where natural and anthropogenic factors were selected as the drivers’ variables in the process of multilayer perceptron neural network Markov chain model. The future land use/cover change (FLUCC) modeling results from 2030 to 2050 show that agriculture is the only land use type with a massive decreasing trend from 1985 to 2050 compared with other categories. The entire change in urban sprawl derived from historical and FLUCC in each period shows that urban construction land increases the fastest between 2020 and 2030. The rapid urbanization along with unplanned urban growth and rising population migration from rural to urban is the main driver of all transformation in land use. These findings facilitate sustainable ecological development in Baghdad City and theoretically support environmental decision making. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, a tripartite evolutionary game model of government, enterprises, and individuals is established to analyze and participate in decision making from the stakeholder perspective. MATLAB is used for numerical simulation analysis. Results show that when the government subsidizes agricultural residues recycling only for enterprises or individuals cannot achieve the expected results. Rather, government subsidies should consider both enterprises and individuals. At the same time, the amount is one of the keys to the effectiveness of the subsidy.

Due to the higher level of automation with respect to traditional agricultural systems, Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) applications generally achieve better yields and quality crops at the expenses of higher energy consumption. In this context, Digital Twin (DT) may constitute a fundamental tool to reach the optimization of the productivity, intended as the ratio between production and resource consumption. For this reason, a DT Architecture for CEA systems is introduced within this work and applied to a case study for its validation. The proposed architecture is potentially able to optimize productivity since it utilizes simulation software that enables the optimization of: (i) Climate control strategies related to the control of the crop microclimate; (ii) treatments related to crop management. Due to the importance of food security in the worldwide landscape, the authors hope that this work may impulse the investigation of strategies for improving the productivity of CEA systems. © 2021 by the authors.

FEWCalc (Food-Energy-Water Calculator) is a new freeware, agent-based model with the novel ability to project farm incomes based on crop selection, irrigation practices, groundwater availability, renewable energy investment, and historical and projected environmental conditions. FEWCalc is used to analyze the interrelated food, energy, water, and climate systems of Finney County, Kansas to evaluate consequences of choices currently available to farmers and resource managers. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to evaluate local farmer choices of crops and renewable energy investment in the face of water resource limitations and global climate change. Metrics of the analysis include agricultural and renewable-energy production, farm income, and water availability and quality. The intended audience includes farmers, resource managers, and scientists focusing on food, energy, and water systems. METHODS: Data derived from publicly available sources are used to support user-specified FEWCalc input values. DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) with added arid-region dynamics is used to obtain simulated crop production and irrigation water demand for FEWCalc. Here, FEWCalc is used to simulate agricultural and energy production and farm income based on continuation of recent ranges of crop prices, farm expenses, and crop insurance; continuation of recent renewable-energy economics and government incentives; one of four climate scenarios, including General Circulation Model projections for Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5; and groundwater-supported irrigation and its limitations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A 50-year (2018-2067) climate and groundwater availability projection process indicates possible trends of future crop yield, water utility, and farm income. The simulation during more wet years produces high crop production and slower depletion of groundwater, as expected. However, surprisingly, the simulations suggest that only the Drier Future scenario is commercially profitable, and this is because of reduced expenses for dryland farming. Although simulated income losses due to low crop production are ameliorated by the energy sector income and crop insurance, the simulation under climate change still produces the worst annual total income. SIGNIFICANCE: FEWCalc addresses scientific, communication, and educational gaps between global- and local-scale FEW research communities and local stakeholders, affected by food, energy, water systems and their interactions by relating near-term choices to near- and long-term consequences. This analysis is needed to craft a more advantageous future. © 2021","Agent-based model; Climate scenarios; Food, energy, and water; Impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability (IAV); Integrated assessment (IA); Renewable energy","adaptive management; agricultural economics; agriculture; climate change; crop production; decision making; decision support system; energy planning; environmental effect; global climate; government; income; integrated approach; investment; water planning; Finney County; Kansas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109503086

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess climate change impacts and adaptation practices (biochar and irrigation) simulated with the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model on nitrate-N (NO3-N) losses, microbial respiration (MR) and soil organic carbon (SOC) in the Southeastern USA. METHODS: The EPIC model was used to assess the impacts of climate change and adaptations on NO3-N losses in leachate and runoff from the soil profile (0–100 cm), loss of soil C via MR (0–100 cm), and impacts on SOC stocks (0–10 cm) for representative farms growing C3 and C4 crops within ten Southeastern USA states. The adaptations explored were annual biochar applications and irrigation. Historical baseline (1979–2009) and future (2041–2070) climate scenarios were used for simulations with CO2 concentrations of 360 ppm and 500 ppm, respectively. Four regional climate models (RCMs), nested within global climate models (GCMs) for their boundary conditions, simulated changes in air temperatures, precipitation, and solar radiation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Climate change increased simulated NO3-N losses in leaching and runoff by 40–80%, compared to historical baseline scenarios that was attributed to overall increased annual precipitation under three of the four RCM_GCM models. For the C4 crops, NO3-N leaching and runoff losses were 16–47% and 31–45% lower than for the C3 crops, respectively. Biochar applications reduced NO3-N leaching in the West region during 2066–2070 under the RCM3_CGCM3 model. The differences in MR between the C4 and C3 crops ranged from 3 to 75%. SOC increased under C4 crops and when biochar was applied. We concluded that inclusion of C4 crops in crop rotations and the applications of biochar under wetter climate scenarios may be a promising adaptation strategy to reduce NO3-N losses and increase SOC content in the soils of the Southeastern USA. SIGNIFICANCE: This study represents one of the first attempts to assess the effectiveness of climate change adaptations such as the agricultural use of biochar and irrigation. The findings from this study strongly contribute to our understanding of potential climate change impacts on a region's agriculture and resulting environmental footprint. This information may be used by the scientific community along with decision and policy makers working on conceptual and practical technologies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on agriculture and the environment. © 2021 The Authors","Adaptation; Biochar; Climate change; Irrigation; Mitigation; Southeastern USA","climate change; climate effect; global climate; leachate; leaching; organic carbon; respiration; runoff; soil carbon; United States; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109151659

While its forest law enforcement strategy was partially successful in combating illegal deforestation, the effectiveness of positive incentive measures in agriculture has been less clear. The reason is that emissions reduction from market-based incentives such as the Brazilian Low-Carbon Agriculture Plan cannot be easily verified with current remote sensing monitoring approaches. Farmers have adopted a large variety of integrated land-use systems of crop, livestock and forestry with highly diverse per-hectare carbon balances. Their responses to policy incentives were largely driven by cost and benefit considerations at the farm level and not necessarily aligned with federal environmental objectives. This article analyzes climate-related land-use policies in the state of Mato Grosso, where highly mechanized soybean–cotton and soybean–maize cropping systems prevail. We employ agent-based bioeconomic simulation together with life-cycle assessment to explicitly capture the heterogeneity of farm-level costs, benefits of adoption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Our analysis confirms previous assessments but suggests a smaller farmer policy response when measured as increase in area of integrated systems. In terms of net carbon balances, our simulation results indicate that mitigation effects at the farm level depended heavily on the exact type of livestock and grazing system. The available data were insufficient to rule out even adverse effects. The Brazilian experience thus offers lessons for other land-rich countries that build their climate mitigation policies on economic incentives in agriculture. © 2021 The Authors","Agricultural land use; Diffusion of climate-friendly technologies; Green financing; High-performance computing; Model uncertainty analysis","agricultural land; environmental economics; environmental policy; incentive; land use change; land use planning; modeling; uncertainty analysis; Brazil; Mato Grosso; Gossypium hirsutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108411864

It creates inefficiency, supports tax fraud, and encourages rent-seeking activities. The net effect is the high tax rates and tax evasion, undermining the potential indirect tax revenues. There are various recommendations from public economists, international agencies, and the industrial sector to reduce the current GST from 17% to single-digit and abolish all kinds of tax exemptions and zero ratings to make it dynamically efficient and pro-growth. With this backdrop, we quantify the likely impacts of uniform GST on macroeconomic aggregates, households’ income, and income inequality of Pakistan by employing a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. CGE models are standard models for economy-wide empirical analysis, and it is widely employed to analyze tax reform and development planning. We have applied 5%, 10%, and 15% uniform GST on the broader base (i.e., leather, textile, carpets, surgical goods, and agriculture sector) instead of a non-uniform GST regime. The simulation results show that uniform GST has a positive impact on economic growth and tax revenue. The sectoral analysis also indicates that the reduction in GST helps develop the domestic industries leading to an increase in the exports of the manufacturing sector. However, the export of agriculture-related products has fallen. Moreover, these policy reforms negatively impact low-income households, especially labor and capital associated with the agriculture sector, thus worsening income inequality. Based on empirical investigation, this paper suggests the implementation of uniform GST in Pakistan. However, to ameliorate the income distribution, the government should increase the reliance on progressive taxes such as wealth, income, and corporate taxes. © 2021 by De La Salle University.","CGE model; GST; GTAP; Inequality; Pakistan; SAM",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115039035

Due to its increasing population and various development projects, as well as current and potential water shortages, Egypt is one of the most populated and impacted countries in Africa and the Middle East in terms of water scarcity. With good future planning, modeling will help to solve water scarcity problems in the Ismailia canal, which is one of the most significant branches of the Nile River. Many previous studies of the Nile river basin depended on quality modeling and hydro-economic models which had policy or system control constraints. To overcome this deficit position and number, the East Nile Delta area was investigated using LINDO (linear interactive, and discrete optimizer) software; a mathematical model with physical constraints (mass balances); and ArcGIS software for canals and water demands from the agriculture sector, which is expected to face a water shortage. Using the total capital (Ismailia canal, groundwater, and water reuse) and total demand for water from different industries, the software measures the shortage area and redistributes the water according to demand node preferences (irrigation, domestic, and industrial water demands). At the irrigation network’s end, a water deficit of 789.81 MCM/year was estimated at Al-Salhiya, Ismailia, El Qantara West, Fayed, and Port Said. The model was then run through three scenarios: (1) the Ismailia Canal Lining’s effect, (2) surface water’s impact, and (3) groundwater’s impact. Water scarcity was proportional to lining four sections at a length of 61.0 km, which is considered to be optimal—based on the simulation which predicts that the Ismailia canal head flow will rise by 15%, according to scenarios—and the most effective way to reduce water scarcity in the face of climate change and limited resources as a result of the increasing population and built-in industrial projects in Egypt. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, developing efficient mechanisms for in situ power transfer to recharge UAV batteries holds potential to extend their mission time. In this paper, we study the use of the far-field wireless power transfer (WPT) technique from specialized, transmitter UAVs (tUAVs) carrying Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antennas for transferring wireless power to receiver UAVs (rUAVs) in a mission. The tUAVs can fly and adjust their distance to the rUAVs to maximize energy transfer gain. The use of MIMO antennas further boosts the energy reception by narrowing the energy beam toward the rUAVs. The complexity of their dynamic operating environment increases with the growing number of tUAVs and rUAVs with varying levels of energy consumption and residual power. We propose an intelligent trajectory selection algorithm for the tUAVs based on a deep reinforcement learning model called Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize the energy transfer gain. The simulation results demonstrate that the PPO-based system achieves about a tenfold increase in flight time for a set of realistic transmit power, distance, sub-band number and antenna numbers. Further, PPO outperforms the benchmark movement strategies of “Traveling Salesman Problem” and “Low Battery First” when used by the tUAVs. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the process was uneven across continents according to economic constraints, and draught animals are currently concentrated in small production units located on terrains that do not favour agriculture mechanisation in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Generally, equids can work at rates similar to those of bovids or faster but can sustain the work for shorter periods of time. In addition, buffaloes possess tough hooves and resistance to disease that make them suitable for working in wetlands and clay soils. Draught animals allow a marked reduction of both GHG emissions and non-renewable energy consumption as compared with agricultural machinery. In addition, they may allow obtaining profits from otherwise non-usable lands. Therefore, their use should be promoted in rural areas where low investments are usually the only ones feasible, and the energy of the animals can be obtained at a low cost by feeding them harvest residues and by-products. However, more attention should be paid to the quality of human–animal interactions—due to the close contact between animals and humans while working—and to the welfare of draught animals when transported and slaughtered—due to the high prevalence of injuries they suffer when subjected to these practices. © 2021 by the authors.

The modified PC algorithm was employed to investigate the causal ordering of energy consumption, CO2 emissions and economic growth across Pakistan’s domestic, industrial, transportation and agricultural sectors. An empirical comparison, i.e., following Monte Carlo simulation experiments demonstrates that the proposed modified PC algorithm is superior to the original PC proposition and can differentiate between true and spurious nexus causalities. Our results show that significant causality is running from energy consumption in industrial and agricultural sectors towards economic growth. There is no causal association between energy consumption and economic growth in the domestic and transportation sectors. On the other hand, causality runs from energy consumption in the transportation, domestic and industrial sectors towards CO2 emissions. It is concluded that energy consumption in industrial and agricultural sectors leads to economic growth alongside the associated CO2 emissions. On the other hand, the contribution of domestic and transportation sectors in economic growth is trivial with significant CO2 emissions.

The research used the quantitative (mathematical regression function, correlation matrix, and R-squared) and qualitative (the SWOT matrix of the agriculture sector in Romania) methods. The data on Romanian agriculture were gathered from Eurostat for the period of 2006–2019. The results showed that there is a direct and positive relationship between the OA and its influencing factors. Moreover, it revealed the negative relationships between the employees in agriculture (−0.58), air pollutants (−0.49), agriculture land (−0.42), irrigation norm (−0.39), agriculture training (−0.33) and the OA, and positive relationships between the area under organic farming (0.56), the average area per holding (0.56), the number of tractors (0.53) and the OA. Romania is a country where employment and agriculture areas are greater than in other EU countries; however, the results of our research highlight the significance of a careful analysis of the influencing factors, of making the difference between the thin line of sustainable performance, of developing new measures, of reducing risks, and of gaining new knowledge and agricultural skills, as an important activity, especially for Romania. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper establishes the relevance of capital as well as transaction costs in structural transformation using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. It is found that reducing transaction costs plays a significant role in aiding structural transformation through increases in value-added for all agricultural processing activities in the economy. When capital stock is increased in addition to the transaction cost decreases, the effects are enhanced. This highlights the importance of complementing production policies with market policies to achieve optimal development results. In the combined simulation labour moved out of agriculture to industry with the quantity of labour employed increasing relatively more for the agricultural processing subsector.

However, a comprehensive assessment of the N source or sink of rice field for the environment is lacking. Here, we conducted the 3-year systematic observations and process-based simulations of N budget at the Jingzhou site in Central China. We identified the roles of rice field and evaluated the opportunities for shifting its role from N source (i.e., outputs &gt; inputs) to sink (i.e., outputs ≤ inputs). Rice field was found to be a N source of 24.2–28.7 kg N ha−1 for waterbodies (including surface and ground waters), but a N sink (2.2–8.8 kg N ha−1) for the atmosphere for the wet and normal year climatic scenarios. The “4R-nutrient stewardship” (i.e., using the right type of N fertilizers, at right rate, right time, and in right place) applied in rice field was sufficient for the source-to-sink shift for the atmosphere for dry year climatic scenario, but needed to implement together with improvements of irrigation and drainage for waterbodies. Furthermore, with the combination of these improved management technologies, rice field played a role as a N sink of up to 22.8 kg N ha−1 for the atmosphere and up to 2.0 kg N ha−1 for waterbodies, along with 24% decrease in irrigation water use and 21% decrease in N application rate without affecting rice yield and soil fertility. Together these findings highlight a possibility to achieve an environmental-friendly rice field by improving agricultural management technologies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cropland; Drainage; Fertilization; Irrigation; Nitrogen budget","Budget control; Drainage; Environmental technology; Fertilizers; Groundwater; Water conservation; Water supply; Climatic scenarios; Cropland; Fertilisation; Management technologies; Nitrogen budgets; Nitrogen sources; Nonpoint sources; Reactive nitrogen; Rice fields; Waterbodies; Irrigation; nitrogen; fertilizer; nitrogen; agricultural land; crop yield; drainage; irrigation; nitrogen; paddy field; agricultural management; Article; atmosphere; biomass; case study; China; controlled study; cropland; evapotranspiration; fertilizer application; flooding; irrigation (agriculture); leaching; nitrogen concentration; nonhuman; precipitation; rice; rice field; runoff; volatilization; water management; agriculture; Oryza; soil; Agriculture; China; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Oryza; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104606183

Together with failures of management implementation, a possible cause for such field observations is that management actions were taken without adequately considering the actual hydrogeological dynamics. To consider this aspect, the paper presents a groundwater flow and transport numerical model of a specific area of the Lombardy Plain. The aim of this model is to demonstrate how modelling, as a management tool, can be useful in the governance process. The groundwater model, using well-known MODFLOW-MT3D codes, is based on existing hydrogeological information, while a nitrogen mass balance has been performed at municipal scale to determine the agricultural N surplus to the subsurface. The model adequately reproduces head levels and nitrate concentrations in observation wells for a 10-year simulation period, showing that 4.5% of the N annual input remains stored in the system. The model indicates the efficiency of rivers and springs to export N out from the system at an estimated rate of 77.5% of the annual N inputs. Back to governance, the model shows that management data at municipal level (e.g. irrigation rates, groundwater withdrawal, N net recharge) provide a satisfactory scale for successfully reproducing nitrate evolution. Hence those variables that can be object of debate during a governance process can be treated as input data to the numerical model. Therefore, backcasting exercises can be conducted to check whether the model outcome fits with the expected results of specific management actions. The model highlights how the N mass balance evolves, providing clues on which factors can be managed to reduce nitrate concentrations and meet the Directive's requirements. Numerical groundwater models, as an option to address water management issues, ultimately contribute to solve the information and capacity governance gaps. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural practices; Backcasting; Irrigation; Po plain; Socio-hydrogeology; Soil System Budget","Budget control; Groundwater flow; Irrigation; Nitrates; Numerical models; Water management; Agricultural practices; Backcasting; Field observations; Governance models; Groundwater modelling; Nitrate concentration; Nitrate Directive; Po plain; Socio-hydrogeology; Soil system budget; Groundwater; ground water; nitrate; nitrogen; agricultural practice; concentration (composition); European Union; governance approach; groundwater; groundwater flow; implementation process; irrigation; nitrate; numerical model; soil water; water budget; anisotropy; aquifer; Article; atmospheric deposition; autumn; concentration (parameter); controlled study; denitrification; dispersity; evapotranspiration; hydraulic conductivity; irrigation (agriculture); Italy; nitrogen cycle; porosity; precipitation; priority journal; river; sediment; spring; summer; temperature; volatilization; water contamination; water management; water quality; water supply; winter; Italy; Lombardy; Po Plain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103926621

We present an approach to collate spatially explicit estimated fluxes of GHGs (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) for main land use sectors in the landscape, to aggregate, and to calculate the net emissions of an entire region. Our procedure was developed and tested in a large river basin in Finland, providing information from intensively studied eLTER research sites. To evaluate the full GHG balance, fluxes from natural ecosystems (lakes, rivers, and undrained mires) were included together with fluxes from anthropogenic activities, agriculture and forestry. We quantified the fluxes based on calculations with an anthropogenic emissions model (FRES) and a forest growth and carbon balance model (PREBAS), as well as on emission coefficients from the literature regarding emissions from lakes, rivers, undrained mires, peat extraction sites and cropland. Spatial data sources included CORINE land use data, soil map, lake and river shorelines, national forest inventory data, and statistical data on anthropogenic activities. Emission uncertainties were evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations. Artificial surfaces were the most emission intensive land-cover class. Lakes and rivers were about as emission intensive as arable land. Forests were the dominant land cover in the region (66%), and the C sink of the forests decreased the total emissions of the region by 72%. The region's net emissions amounted to 4.37 ± 1.43 Tg CO2-eq yr−1, corresponding to a net emission intensity 0.16 Gg CO2-eq km−2 yr−1, and estimated per capita net emissions of 5.6 Mg CO2-eq yr−1. Our landscape approach opens opportunities to examine the sensitivities of important GHG fluxes to changes in land use and climate, management actions, and mitigation of anthropogenic emissions. © 2021 The Authors","Anthropogenic; Crop land; Forest; GHG; Mire; Waterbodies","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Forestry; Intelligent systems; Lakes; Land use; Monte Carlo methods; Nitrogen oxides; Rivers; Anthropogenic activity; Anthropogenics; Crop land; Forest; Greenhouses gas; Mire; Source and sink; Spatially explicit; Undrained; Waterbodies; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; agricultural land; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; climate change; emission inventory; forest; forest inventory; greenhouse gas; landscape structure; methane; mire; Monte Carlo analysis; nitrous oxide; quantitative analysis; source-sink dynamics; agriculture; air pollution; aquatic environment; arable land; Article; carbon balance; climate change; combustion; cropland; Finland; forest; fuel combustion; greenhouse gas; land use; Monte Carlo method; peat extraction; peatland; priority journal; river basin; source sink relationship; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103384941

The FAO estimates that wildfires result in at least USD 1 billion in agriculture-related losses due to the destruction of livestock pasture, destruction of agricultural buildings, premature death of farm animals, and general disruption of agricultural activities. Even though artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithms (GAs), probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), and adaptive neurofuzzy inference systems (AN-FISs), among others, have proven useful in fire prevention, their application is limited in real farm environments. Most farms rely on traditional/non-technology-based methods of fire prevention. The case for AI in agricultural fire prevention is grounded on the accuracy and reliability of computer simulations in smoke movement analysis, risk assessment, and postfire analysis. In addition, such technologies can be coupled with next-generation fire-retardant materials such as intumescent coatings with a polymer binder, blowing agent, carbon donor, and acid donor. Future prospects for AI in agriculture transcend basic fire safety to encompass Society 5.0, energy systems in smart cities, UAV monitoring, Agriculture 4.0, and decentralized energy. However, critical challenges must be overcome, including the health and safety aspects, cost, and reliability. In brief, AI offers un-limited potential in the prevention of fire hazards in farms, but the existing body of knowledge is inadequate. © 2021 by the authors.

Existing technologies allow farmers to cool down plants by a few degrees during critical periods, reducing the damage from excess heat. With nonlinear effects of high temperatures on yields, slight cooling can bring significant gains in many crops.

Our case study deals with California pistachios, threatened by warming daytime temperatures in the winter. A new solution for sunlight reflection, based on products already used in other contexts and crops, could potentially help deal with this challenge. We develop a model to analyze grower choice and market outcomes with MCE for California pistachios. The expected increase in welfare for the period of 2020–2040 is assessed at 0.49–1.42 billion dollars under several scenarios. Simulation results show increases in consumer surplus and total welfare when MCE is available but decreases in aggregate grower profits.

However, adequately prioritizing AMR interventions in such settings requires a quantification of the relative impacts of environmental, animal, and human sources in a One-Health perspective. Here, we propose a stochastic quantitative risk assessment model for the different components at interplay in AMR selection and spread. The model computes the incidence of AMR colonization in humans from five different sources: water or food consumption, contacts with livestock, and interhuman contacts in hospitals or the community, and combines these incidences into a per-year acquisition risk. Using data from the literature and Monte-Carlo simulations, we apply the model to hypothetical Asian-like settings, focusing on resistant bacteria that may cause infections in humans. In both scenarios A, illustrative of low-income countries, and B, illustrative of high-income countries, the overall individual risk of becoming colonized with resistant bacteria at least once per year is high. However, the average predicted incidence of colonization was lower in scenario B at 0.82 (CrI [0.13, 5.1]) acquisitions/person/year, versus 1.69 (CrI [0.66, 11.13]) acquisitions/person/year for scenario A. A high percentage of population with no access to improved water on premises and a high percentage of population involved in husbandry are shown to strongly increase the AMR acquisition risk. The One-Health AMR risk assessment framework we developed may prove useful to policymakers throughout Asia, as it can easily be parameterized to realistically reproduce conditions in a given country, provided data are available. © 2020 Society for Risk Analysis","Acquisition; antibiotic resistance; Asia; exposure assessment; health risk assessment; Monte-Carlo simulation; One-Health; transmission summary for social media","Agriculture; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Chromium compounds; Food supply; Health; Health risks; Iodine compounds; Monte Carlo methods; Risk perception; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Antibiotic resistance; Antimicrobial resistances; Health perspective; Low income countries; Quantitative modeling; Quantitative risk assessment; Resistant bacteria; Risk assessment framework; Risk assessment; antibiotic resistance; colonization; disease incidence; disease spread; hospital sector; policy making; risk assessment; sanitation; Asia; antiinfective agent; water; animal; antibiotic resistance; Asia; Asian; bacterium; food; human; incidence; livestock; Monte Carlo method; One Health; prevalence; procedures; reproducibility; risk assessment; sanitation; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Asia; Asians; Bacteria; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Food; Humans; Incidence; Livestock; Monte Carlo Method; One Health; Prevalence; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; Sanitation; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094637503

Sudden increases in solar power facilities have caused the physical destruction of wildlife habitats, thereby resulting in the decline of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. However, previous assessments have been based on the environmental impact of large solar photovoltaics (PVs). The impact of medium-sized PV facilities (0.5–10 MW), which can alter small habitat patches through the accumulation of installations has not been assessed. Here, we quantified the amount of habitat loss directly related to the construction of PV facilities with different size classes and estimated their siting attributes using construction patterns in Japan and South Korea. We identified that a comparable amount of natural and semi-natural habitats were lost due to the recent installation of medium solar facilities (approximately 66.36 and 85.73% of the overall loss in Japan and South Korea, respectively). Compared to large solar PVs, medium PV installations resulted in a higher area loss of semi-natural habitats, including secondary/planted forests, secondary/artificial grasslands, and agricultural lands. The siting attributes of medium and large solar PV facilities indicated a preference for cost-based site selection rather than prioritizing habitat protection for biodiversity conservation. Moreover, even conservation areas were developed when economic and topological conditions were suitable for energy production. Our simulations indicate that increasing the construction of PVs in urban areas could help reduce the loss of natural and semi-natural habitats. To improve the renewable energy share while mitigating the impacts on biodiversity, our results stress the need for a proactive assessment to enforce sustainable site-selection criteria for solar PVs in renewable energy initiatives. The revised criteria should consider the cumulative impacts of varied size classes of solar power facilities, including medium PVs, and the diverse aspects of the ecological value of natural habitats. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change adaptation; Cumulative effect; Habitat fragmentation; Land cover change; Renewable energy; Sustainable development","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Climate change; Conservation; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Site selection; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Climate change adaptation; Cumulative effects; Habitat fragmentation; Land-cover change; Natural habitat; Photovoltaics; Power; Renewable energies; Size class; Solar photovoltaics; Sustainable development; agriculture; alternative energy; biodiversity; climate change; environmental impact; environmental planning; habitat fragmentation; land use change; photovoltaic system; solar power; sustainable development; agricultural land; article; climate change; conservation biology; energy yield; forest; grassland; habitat fragmentation; Japan; physiological stress; renewable energy; simulation; siting; South Korea; sustainable development; urban area; Japan; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102969718

Excessive application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer has been pervasive in this region, and the unrecovered N eventually escaped from croplands in forms of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission and N leaching. Mitigating these negative impacts is hindered by a lack of practical information on where to focus and how much mitigation potential to expect. At a large scale, process-based crop models are the primary tools for predicting variables required by decision making, but their applications are prohibited by expensive computational and data storage costs. To overcome these challenges, we built a series of metamodels to learn the key mechanisms regarding the carbon (C) and N cycle from a well-validated process-based biogeochemical model, ecosys. The trained metamodel captures over 98% of the variability of the ecosys simulated outputs for 99 randomly selected counties in Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana. To identify hotspots with high mitigation potential, we introduce net societal benefit (NSB) as an indicator for synthesizing the loss in yield and social benefits through emissions and pollutants avoided. Our results show that reducing N fertilizer by 10% leads to 9.8% less N2O emissions and 9.6% less N leaching at the cost of 4.9% more SOC depletion and 0.6% yield reduction over the study region. The estimated total annual NSB is $395 M (uncertainty ranges from $114 M to $1271 M), including $334 from social benefits (uncertainty ranges from $46 M to $1076 M), $100 M from saving fertilizer (uncertainty ranges from $13 M to $455 M), and -$40 M due to yield changes (uncertainty ranges from -$261 M to $69 M). For the median scenario, we noted that 20% of the study area accounts for nearly 50% of the NSB, and thus represent hotspot locations for targeted mitigation. Although the uncertainty range suggests that developing such a high-resolution framework is not yet settled and the scenario based estimations are not appropriate to inform the management practices for individual farmers, our efforts shed light on the new generation of analytical tools for life cycle assessment. © 2021 The Author(s).

In recent years, many countries have gradually adopted adaption strategies to climate change, with the aim of reducing the impact of climate variabilities. Taiwan is in a geographical location that is prone to natural disasters and is thus very vulnerable to climate change. To explore an appropriate method for Taiwan to adapt to climate change, this study took Dajia River Basin as the simulation site to explore the potential climate change impact in the area. An impact study was conducted to identify the trend of flooding under climate change scenarios. We used the SOBEK model to simulate downstream inundation caused by the worst typhoon event of the 20th century (1979–2003) and for typhoon events that might occur at the end of the 21st century (2075–2099) in Taiwan, according to the climate change scenario of representative concentration pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) and dynamical downscaling rainfall data. Agricultural lands were found to be the most affected areas among all land types, and the flooded area was forecast to increase by 1.89 times by the end of 21st century, when compared to the end of 20th century. In this study, upland crops, which are affected the most by flooding, were selected as the adaptation targets for this site and multiple engineering and non-engineering options were presented to reduce the potential climate change impacts. With respect to the results, we found that all adaptation options, even when considering the cost, yield higher benefits than the “do-nothing” option. Among the adaptation options presented for this site, utilizing engineering methods with non-engineering methods show the best result in effectively reducing the impact of climate change, with the benefit-to-cost ratio being around 1.16. This study attempts to explore useful and effective assessment methods for providing sound scientific and economic evidence for the selection of adequate adaption options for flood impacts in agriculture in the planning phase. © 2021 by the authors.

Transhumance has been implicated in such spread as well as that of related tick-borne diseases (TBD). Methods and principal findings: Using a questionnaire survey and statistical modelling, this study explores the perception of herders about ticks and TBD in cattle, their practices in tick control and the social groups involved in cattle farming in eastern Burkina Faso (46 random herds) and in the northern Benin (44 random herds). Results show that most of the herders (79%) are from the Fulani social group. The principal and secondary activities of herders are respectively cattle farming and agriculture. The mean age of pastoralists is between 40 and 50 years depending on the province of origin and 60% of the surveyed herds practice internal or transboundary transhumance. Herders have a clear knowledge of different genus of ticks except the genus Rhipicephalus. Their knowledge of TBD is very limited. These results also reveal that herders in Benin use less acaricides treatment calendar compared with those in Burkina Faso. Transhumant pastoralists (i.e. transhumant cattle farmers) plan more acaricide treatment and have more cows with lost teats (i.e. tick damage) than the sedentary ones. In addition, amitraz appears to be the main acaricide compound used by herders for tick control (68%) but its use is inappropriate and its source is frequently the unregulated market. Conclusions and significance: All of these findings can induce acaricide resistance especially as the inefficacy of amitraz against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus has already been reported in previous studies. Such results would help to elaborate suitable strategies of control and prevention of ticks and TBD in Burkina Faso and Benin. © 2021 The Authors Veterinary Medicine and Science Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Benin; Burkina Faso; pastoralist; socio-epidemiological survey; tick-borne diseases; ticks; transboundary diseases; transhumance","acaricide; amitraz; cypermethrin; deltamethrin; anaplasmosis; animal experiment; Arbovirus; Article; cattle disease; cattle farming; climate change; disease simulation; environmental factor; health survey; human; milk production; nonhuman; questionnaire; risk factor; seasonal variation; tick borne disease; tick control; tick infestation; virus transmission; adult; agricultural worker; animal; animal husbandry; attitude to health; bovine; Burkina Faso; middle aged; perception; psychology; tick; tick borne disease; Adult; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Burkina Faso; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Farmers; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Middle Aged; Perception; Tick Control; Tick-Borne Diseases; Ticks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105924687

The result is a database of simulations representing multiple plausible futures which offers information on uncertainty regarding scenario assumptions and model structure (through the ensemble spread). Using an iterative robust decision-making framework, simulation results are coupled with experts' knowledge and opinion to detect vulnerabilities in the proposed strategies, quantify potential trade-offs between responses, and identify a robust adaptation strategy. Methods are illustrated as applied to the Órbigo Catchment in Northwestern Spain, where the Douro River Basin Authority (DRBA) will decide in the coming months whether to build two dams to enhance irrigation water supply and reliability. Simulation results show that, for most scenarios and models considered, dam construction costs lead to water prices beyond the willingness of local cereal-growing irrigators to pay. Following a robust decision-making process, parties to the decision unanimously declared the status quo (i.e., no dam construction) strategy to be preferred to the dam construction strategy. This outcome substantiates the need for economic assessments of dam construction projects that account for nonlinear responses by agents to complement technical assessments in decision making. © 2021 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.",,"Catchments; Costs; Cultivation; Dams; Economic and social effects; Irrigation; Iterative methods; Mathematical programming; Water supply; Adaptation strategies; Economic assessments; Economic performance; Irrigated agriculture; Irrigation water supply; Mathematical programming models; Multi-model ensemble; Technical assessment; Decision making; adaptive management; dam construction; decision making; economic analysis; ensemble forecasting; irrigation; microeconomics; modeling; water supply; Castilla y Leon; Orbigo River; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105777789

Eco-city construction has been implemented in many countries in recent years; however, quantitative research on its economic impact has only started. This study establishes a theoretical model of the impact of eco-city construction on a firm’s research and development (R&D) investment. The numerical simulation results show that eco-city construction promotes a firm’s R&D investment and long-term earnings from two aspects: (1) macro policies increase a firm’s exogenous uncertainty and (2) ecological capital enhances a firm’s business conditions. The empirical study matches the microscopic data of 115 cities and 2612 listed firms in China from 2008 to 2017, and results show that eco-city construction has a significant positive impact on firm innovation input and output. Further research shows that this positive impact mainly comes from ecological environment and ecological economy, and there is regional heterogeneity. For the first time, this study affirms the positive role of eco-city construction from the perspective of firm innovation activities at the micro level. It provides strong evidence for the government to realise the sustainable development of firms by accelerating eco-city construction. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Eco-city; Empirical research; Firm innovation; Numerical simulation; Regional heterogeneity","economic impact; environmental protection; firm size; innovation; research and development; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainable development; urban agriculture; urban area; China; China; city; environmental protection; sustainable development; theoretical model; China; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Models, Theoretical; Sustainable Development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102692761

These largely stakeholder-led, innovative policy actions were supported by modern tools of remote sensing and Geographic Information System technology that allowed stakeholders to make adjustments to existing resource management and jurisdictional boundaries to form policy-mandated Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSAs) and Salinity Management Areas (SMAs) to address future management responsibilities.

The study implemented the Calvo price stick model based on an agent in a general equilibrium and New Keynesian type, simulated using DSGE-VAR. The approach permits the indexing formula to include expected corn inflation rather than lagged inflation. The results show that corn price inflation only persists by 2% every trading year, resulting from changes in the immediate future corn-price inflation and output-gap, respectively. The shock to stochastic term only causes a partial decline in the corn price, converging at a future date with its long-run equilibrium. The experiment confirmed that corn price fluctuations are beyond the purview of the domestic economy, and any attempt to impose price policies will offset the price setting, creating further distortions and a wider gap in the corn yield. The study provides fresh insight into the Calvo price stick model of the New Keynesian type and its use to forecast agricultural outcomes. © 2021 Olatunji A.

There is evidence to suggest that co-locating solar power production and agriculture, known as agrivoltaic systems, may be a means to reduce concern over the latter. A model is developed to test whether co-location can reduce weather-related financial risk for a landowner, a largely unexplored question, while improving profitability. Stochastically generated weather variables and commodity prices are used to simulate net revenues for a solar only plot, a farm only plot, and an agrivoltaic plot. Application to four test cases (alfalfa/soybeans in Oregon and soybeans/strawberries in North Carolina) illustrate the potential impact of agrivoltaics. Results from the scenarios evaluated indicate that co-location can increase annual net revenues relative to a farm-only scenario by 300–5000%. For crops subject to considerable risk via weather and market conditions, such as strawberries, co-location diversifies income streams, reducing revenue volatility and lifting worst case net revenues by 48–53%. In this sense, agrivoltaics may also be a partial substitute for federal crop insurance. While the locations and cases considered here were limited, this framework is applicable to any location or crop and results suggest that agrivoltaics have the potential to increase farmers’ revenues and improve financial stability during volatile weather and market conditions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Agrivoltaic systems; Financial risk; Hydrometereological uncertainty; Solar power production","Commerce; Crops; Finance; Land use; Location; Risk perception; Agrivoltaic system; Colocations; Diversification strategies; Energy producers; Extreme weather; Financial risks; Hydrometereological uncertainty; Market condition; Net revenue; Solar power production; Solar energy; alfalfa; commodity; federal system; fruit; landowner; risk assessment; simulation; soybean; North Carolina; Oregon; United States; Glycine max; Medicago sativa; Rosa carolina carolina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110407123

Despite the many benefits of CA, there are few farmers around the world that have simultaneously implemented all facets of the strategy. In part, this reflects the challenges in applying, adapting, and understanding this complex and multi-dimensional agricultural innovation in the context of diverse farming systems. In this paper, we applied an integrated framework that combines bioeconomic simulation, risk analysis, adoption theory, and impact assessment to investigate how various combinations of CA components (no-tillage, soil cover, crop diversification, plus growing a new crop or variety) performed over a 10-year period in representative farms in a central Mexican case study. We found significant differences in profit, net value, downside risk, and risk-aversion cost between double-component scenarios (and improved CA to a lesser extent) and all other scenarios, which suggested that disaggregating CA into smaller component packages could increase farmer adoption in risky contexts. Our findings provided valuable insights on CA feasibility and could help establish policy and reporting metrics. The study highlighted the need for employing a range of research tools to understand the relative value of agricultural innovations and to identify and reduce trade-offs and uncertainty in farming systems. © 2021 by the authors.

Agriculture is an essential economic sector that can profit from the application of renewable energy sources by the assimilation of off‐grid, arid and barren terrains. Power supplied by hybrid systems for water pumping is a solution for overcoming the stochastic character of the renewable energy sources. This paper presents a sizing methodology for a hybrid system with wind and PV generation and water tank storage, based on the consideration of the entire energy conversion chain with energy models and a one‐year operation simulation. The PV generator is modeled using a reduced Durisch’s model, while for the wind generator a piecewise interpolation is used. The methodology is applied for sites in Bulgaria with specific agricultural crops and meteorological data. Combinations of PV (different technologies) and wind (different types) generators and water tank capacities are considered and discussed. The combinations are compared on the basis of three criteria: the investment cost, the satisfaction of crop requirements and system oversizing. The possibility for the introduction of battery storage is also examined. The results show some trends in the hybrid system sizing and the possibility to apply the proposed methodology for various sites, generators and crops. © 2021 by the authors.

However, due to intensive agriculture development, the water quality has deteriorated over the past decades. An effective measure to improve water quality is to control the agricultural non-point source (NPS) pollution through elaborate schemes based on eco-compensation. In order to develop such eco-compensation schemes, three scenarios of agricultural activity adjustment were designed: S1 (halving fertilization every year), S2 (fallow every other year), and S3 (returning agricultural land to forest). A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was adopted to simulate runoff, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. Based on SWAT results, a multi-criteria spatial evaluation model considering the environmental, economic, and social effects of eco-compensation was created for best scenario decision. The results reveal the following: (1) the total nutrients loss of agricultural land reduces in all scenarios, but S2 has more reduction compared to S1 and S3; (2) from the comprehensive perspective of environment–economy–society effects, S2 is the best scenario for rice land and dry land; (3) the comprehensive effect of eco-compensation at the grid scale has a significant spatial difference, and therefore, we highlight the necessity and significance of controlling agricultural NPS pollution by eco-compensation on a precise spatial scale. This study can broaden the application field of the SWAT model and provide a scientific basis and experience for the evaluation and spatial design of agriculture eco-compensation. © 2021 by the authors.

However, limited researches have been focused on the whole national agricultural bioenergy resources in Egypt. This research provides an assessment of the potential agricultural biomass resources for electric energy production in Egypt. It provides a strategic perspective for the design of a national network of biomass power plants to utilize the spatially available agricultural residues throughout a country. A comprehensive approach is presented and is applied to Egypt. First, the approach estimates the amount, type, and characteristics of the agricultural residues in each Egyptian governorate. Then, a techno-economic appraisal for locating a set of collection stations, and installing a direct combustion biomass power plant in each governorate is conducted. SAM simulation software is used for the technical and economic appraisals, and preliminary plant capacities are estimated assuming one plant in each governorate. Secondly, a new mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed and applied to optimally design a biomass supply chain national network to maximize the overall network profit. The network is composed of the collection stations, the potential biomass power plants, and the flow distribution of residues to supply the selected plants. Results indicate that the Egyptian agricultural residue resources can produce 10 million ton/year of dry residues, generate 11 TWh/year, an average levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of 6.77 ¢/kWh, and supply about 5.5% of Egypt’s current energy needs. Moreover, the optimization results reveal that a network of 5 biomass power plants with capacities of 460 MW each should be established in Egypt.

In this paper, we present two novel system dynamics simulation models - termed 'Sustainable Alternative Futures for India' (SAFARI) and SAFARI-R (a regionally disaggregated version of SAFARI) - that can be used to develop and analyse specific interventions required at the national and regional levels to sustainably maintain food security. Our simulation results show that increasing micro-irrigation coverage, limiting sugarcane cultivation, and improving water recycling in domestic and industrial sectors can help achieve food production sufficiency within the limitations posed by the availability of natural resources. Alternatively, a behavioural shift towards eating (and cultivating) coarse cereals instead of rice (which is water intensive) is another effective intervention, especially when combined with micro-irrigation or crop yield improvements, and reduced sugarcane cultivation. When compared to a scenario where current practices continue, these alternative pathways to food security can reduce annual water consumption for irrigation by 18%-24%, electricity demand for irrigation by 60%-65%, and the agriculture sector's total (direct + indirect) GHG emissions by 17%-25%, by 2050. Further, simulations on SAFARI-R indicate that the north, centre, and west zones of the country are considerably pressed for water, while the south and east zones could run out of land. As a way to meet the food demand in these zones in future, the possibility of crop redistribution is explored along with other strategies such as reducing groundwater dependence. © 2021 The Author(s).

This paper employs system dynamics modeling to determine hydrologic and economic implications of an irrigation efficiency (IE) policy (increased conveyance efficiency and field efficiency) in a coupled sociohydrologic system with three climate scenarios. Simulations are conducted within the lower Rio Grande region (LRG) of New Mexico for the years 1969 to 2099, including water, land, capital, and population modules. Quadrant analysis is utilized to compare the IE policy outcomes with the base case and to categorize results of simulations according to hydrologic and economic sustainability. The four categories are beneficial, unacceptable, unsus-tainable agricultural development, and unsustainable hydrology. Simulation results for the IE policy analyzed here fall into the categories of unsustainable agricultural development or unacceptable, suggesting there are long-term negative effects to regional economies in all scenarios with mixed results for hydrologic variables. IE policy can yield water for redistribution as increased unit water supply in the field produces more deep percolation; however, IE policy sacrifices regional connec-tivity. Specifically, simulation results show that the policy increases abundance by 4.7–74.5% and return flow by −3.0–9.9%. These positive results, however, come at the cost of decreased hydrologic connectivity (−31.5 to −25.1%) and negative economic impacts (−32.7 to −5.7%). Long-term net depletions in groundwater are also observed from loss of hydrologic connectivity and increased agricultural water demand from projections of increased consumptive use of crops. Adaptive water management that limits water use in drought years and replenishes groundwater in abundant years as well as economic incentives to offset the costs of infrastructure improvements will be necessary for the IE policy to result in sustainable agriculture and water resources. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on the structure of the aggregate exposure model and the nature of variable distributions, we optimized the framework to achieve a simplified mathematical expression based on lognormal variables including the lognormal sum approximation and lognormal product theorem. The proposed model was validated using Monte Carlo simulation, which demonstrates a good match for both head and tail ends of the distribution (e.g., the maximum error = 2.01% at the 99th percentile). In comparison with the point estimate approach (i.e., theoretical maximum daily intake, TMDI), the proposed model produced higher simulated daily intake (SDI) values based on empirical and precautionary assumptions. For example, the values at the 75th percentile of the SDI distributions simulated from the European Union (EU) MRLs of 13 common pesticides in 12 common crops were equal to the estimated TMDI values, and the SDI values at the 99th percentile were over 1.6-times the corresponding TMDI values. Furthermore, the model was refined by incorporating the lognormal distributions of biometric variables (i.e., food intake rate, processing factor, and body weight) and varying the unit-to-unit variability factor (VF) of the pesticide residues in crops. This ensures that our proposed model is flexible across a broad spectrum of pesticide residues. Overall, our results show that the SDI is significantly reduced, which may better reflect reality. In addition, using a point estimate or lognormal PF distribution is effective as risk assessments typically focus on the upper end of the distribution. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Crop contamination; Health risks; Pesticide regulation","Aggregates; Chemical contamination; Estimation; Health risks; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Pesticide effects; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Aggregate exposure; Crop contamination; Daily intake; Log-normal; Log-normal model; Maximum residue levels; Pesticide regulation; Pesticide residue; Point estimate; Regulatory standards; Crops; pesticide; pesticide; pesticide residue; agricultural practice; crop plant; European Union; health risk; modeling; occupational exposure; pesticide; risk assessment; agriculture; Article; body weight; concentration (parameter); contamination; crop management; food intake; health hazard; pesticide spraying; statistical model; crop; food contamination; Europe; Agriculture; Crops, Agricultural; Food Contamination; Pesticide Residues; Pesticides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102370553

Using a choice-based conjoint (CBC) analysis, we measured public preferences regarding different constitutive attributes of PES (e.g., types of agro-environmental measures, conditions of payment, responsible institutions, intervention sites) that aimed to reduce pollution from agricultural sources and increase biodiversity in the agricultural landscapes of southern Quebec. The CBC analysis revealed a strong preference by the respondents for a reduction of pesticide dependency in their choice of attributes with regard to the proposed scenarios. By carrying out PES scenario simulations, this study demonstrates that there is a ten times higher willingness to pay for pesticide reduction scenarios than for scenarios aiming to restore hydric resources such as wetlands and riparian-zones. In addition, this study finds a mixed interest in PES programs since ecosystem services generated by agro-environmental practices seem to be misunderstood by the public. Therefore, pesticide reduction could be used as a strategy for financing PES initiatives that are socially acceptable while bringing farmers flexibility in their choice of agro-environmental practices. In this way farmers can achieve pesticide reduction goals while promoting a bundle of ecosystem services. © 2021","Choice-based conjoint analysis; Environmental policy; Payments for ecosystem services; Public opinion; Scenario simulation","agricultural land; ecosystem service; pollutant source; pollution control; willingness to pay; Canada; Quebec [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101146836

This is particularly important for the food-water-land-ecosystems (FWLE) nexus, which is fundamental for the achievement of at least six of the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A holistic understanding of the FWLE nexus interactions and how and to what extent various exogenous drivers of change affect them is therefore central to cross-sectoral adaptation planning. Here, we present such an integrated assessment for Europe applying a regional Integrated Assessment Platform (IAP). The study explores a wide range of future climate and socio-economic scenarios using more than 900 model simulations. The results show that food production is likely to be the main driver of Europe's future landscape change dynamics (with or without climate change). Agriculture and land use allocation is often driven by complex cross-sectoral interactions with cascading effects on other sectors such as forestry, biodiversity, and water under the various scenarios. The modelling also highlighted that while sustaining current levels of food production at the European level could be achievable under most climate and socio-economic scenarios, there are significant regional differences with winners and losers. The analysis raises the question of whether current production and consumption policies are sustainable in the long-term. Such systematic integrated model-based analysis plays a crucial role in informing development of cross-sectoral policies that maximise synergies and minimise trade-offs across nexus sectors, regions, and scenarios.

However, nitrate (NO3−) contamination in agriculturally intensive regions poses a threat to groundwater resources under AgMAR. We use a reactive transport model to understand the effects of AgMAR management strategies (i.e., by varying the frequency, duration between flooding events, and amount of water) on NO3− leaching to groundwater under different stratigraphic configurations and antecedent moisture conditions. We examine the potential of denitrification and nitrogen retention in deep vadose zone sediments (∼15 m) using variable AgMAR application rates on two-dimensional representations of differently textured soils, soils with discontinuous bands/channels, and with preferential flow paths characteristic of agricultural fields. Simulations indicate finer textured sediments, alone or embedded within/adjacent to high flow regions, are important reducing zones providing conditions needed for denitrification. Simulation results suggest that applying water all-at-once rather than in increments transports higher concentrations of NO3− deeper into the profile, which may exacerbate groundwater quality. This transport into deeper depths can be aggravated by wetter antecedent soil moisture conditions. However, applying water all-at-once also increases denitrification within the vadose zone by promoting anoxic conditions. We conclude that AgMAR can be designed to enhance denitrification in the subsurface and reduce NO3− leaching to groundwater, while specifically accounting for lithologic heterogeneity, antecedent soil moisture conditions, and depth to the water table. Our findings are potentially relevant to other systems that experience flooding inundation such as floodplains and dedicated recharge basins. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

Projected changes in climate, thus, pose a threat since crop production is mainly rain-fed. The impact of climate change and its variation on the productivity of cereals in smallholder settings under future production systems in Navrongo, Ghana and Nioro du Rip, Senegal was assessed in this study. Data on management practices obtained from household surveys and projected agricultural development pathways (through stakeholder engagements), soil data, weather data (historical: 1980–2009 and five General Circulation Models; mid-century time slice 2040–2069 for two Representative Concentration Pathways; 4.5 and 8.5) were used for the impact assessment, employing a crop simulation model. Ensemble maize yield changes under the sustainable agricultural development pathway (SDP) were −13 and −16%, while under the unsustainable development pathway (USDP), yield changes were −19 and −20% in Navrongo and Nioro du Rip, respectively. The impact on sorghum and millet were lower than that on maize. Variations in climate change impact among smallholders were high with relative standard deviations (RSD) of between 14% and 60% across the cereals with variability being higher under the USDP, except for millet. Agricultural production systems with higher intensification but with less emphasis on soil conservation (USDP) will be more negatively impacted by climate change compared to relatively sustainable ones (SDP). © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, developing models to assess them has become more relevant. This work systematically reviews the literature on the tools used to evaluate water and food resources between 2002 and 2020. Furthermore, it reports a critical analysis of the software used to assess the WF Nexus quantitatively. The models analyzed were Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Common Agricultural Policy Regional Impact (CAPRI), Global Food and Water System (GFWS), Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), Water Evaluation And Planning system (WEAP), and Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP). We deduced that the following are necessary in evaluating the WF Nexus: (1) the capacity to generate future scenarios, (2) a global application, and (3) the application in case studies. The present paper is the first review to provide an overview of the software applied to evaluate WF Nexus, including the advantages and disadvantages of the tools found. They can help build sustainability criteria when designing policies that reduce water and food security risks and promote efficient water and food use. © 2021 by the authors.

These impacts are more prevalent in low-and-middle income countries (LMIC) due to weak regulations, lack of awareness of the risks of contamination, predominant use of handheld backpack style spraying equipment, general lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), and low literacy about proper agrochemical application techniques. Reducing exposure to agrochemicals was identified as a paramount concern by rural Hondurans working with a community-engaged research initiative. Fluorescent tracer dyes have been described as a means of visualizing and quantifying dermal exposure to agricultural chemicals, and exposure models adapted for LMIC have been developed previously. Tracer dyes have also been used in educational simulations to promote pesticide safety. However, studies evaluating the effectiveness of these educational dye interventions in reducing future exposure have been lacking. Aim: To evaluate whether observing one's own chemical contamination after applying agrochemicals changed the amount of occupational dermal exposure during a subsequent chemical application. Methods: We employed a multi-modal community intervention in a rural village in Honduras that incorporated chemical safety education and use of a fluorescent tracer dye during pesticide application on two consecutive occasions, and compared dermal exposure between the intervention group (previous dye experience and safety education, n = 6) and the control group (safety education only, n = 7). Results: Mean total visual score (TVS) of the tracer dye, which accounts for both extent and intensity of whole-body contamination, was lower among those who had previously experienced the dye intervention (mean TVS = 41.3) than among participants who were dye-naïve (mean TVS = 78.4), with a difference between means of −37.10 (95% CI [-66.26, −7.95], p = 0.02). Stratifying by body part, contamination was significantly lower for the anterior left lower extremity and bilateral feet for the dye-experienced group vs. dye-naïve, with most other segments showing a trend toward decreased contamination as well. Conclusion: Participants who had previously experienced the dye intervention were significantly less contaminated than the dye-naïve control group during a subsequent spraying event. The findings of this small pilot study suggest that a multi-modal, community-based approach that utilizes fluorescence-augmented contamination for individualized learning (FACIL) may be effective in reducing dermal exposure to carcinogenic agrochemicals among subsistence farmers in Honduras and other LMIC. © 2021 The Authors","Community-based participatory research; Dermal exposure; Fluorescent tracer dye; Honduras; Low and middle-income countries; Pesticides","agricultural chemical; carcinogen; fluorescent dye; pesticide; agricultural worker; agriculture; Honduras; human; occupational exposure; pilot study; Agriculture; Agrochemicals; Carcinogens; Farmers; Fluorescent Dyes; Honduras; Humans; Occupational Exposure; Pesticides; Pilot Projects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103420626

We first develop a theoretical model to study the decision to convert land from an extensive (or biodiversity-friendly) use to an intensive use (e.g., crop agriculture) in the presence of network economies in land use returns. The model supports the possibility of multiple land use equilibria due to network economies and identifies policy outcomes that increase welfare. Bandwagon effects can occur whereby spatial production spillovers from lands under intensive use can prompt further conversions on proximate lands under extensive use. Conversely, conservation sites can be placed strategically to block conversion cascades. Lands that support moderate ecological benefits but have strong intensive use potential are desirable conservation targets when these preempt conversion cascades, which is in contrast with the conservation strategies that aim to maximize ecological benefits per unit cost. When network economies exist in land use returns as well as in ecological benefits, a Pigouvian subsidy is shown to favor extensive land cover while a subsidy payment upon preservation of adjacent lands can tilt incentives in favor of either land use. We illustrate our findings with landscape-level simulations calibrated to the U.S. Prairie Pothole Region (PPR). Finally, we estimate grassland conversion hazard by employing satellite imagery to provide statistical evidence for land use network economies in the PPR. © 2021","Bandwagon effects; Conservation mechanisms; Land use cascades; Network economies; Production spillovers; Satellite data; Spatial topology; Waterfowl conservation","Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Cost effectiveness; Ecology; Satellite imagery; Bandwagon effect; Conservation strategies; Conservation targets; Ecological benefits; Prairie potholes; Production network; Statistical evidence; Theoretical modeling; Land use; conservation status; cost-benefit analysis; grassland; land use; satellite imagery; strategic approach; Prairie Pothole Region; United States; Anatidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102855846

As the first country hit by COVID-19, China has adopted a series of stringent mitigation policies to contain the spread of virus. This has led to food system disruptions due to restrictions on labor and interruption of transport, processing, retailing, and input distribution. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this contribution is to report evidence for initial impacts and resilience of China's food system amid the COVID-19 pandemic and to discuss government's responses as well as long-term efforts that promoted resilience. METHODS: We reviewed a range of publications, government released reports and official information, blogs, and media articles, and whenever possible, we complemented this qualitative information with quantitative data from China's National Bureau of Statistics and finally empirical data obtained from a simulation study. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We identified China's earlier responses in each key food system activities including ensuring effective logistics of agricultural products and inputs, supporting production and processing, matching supply with demand, and mitigating consumer's income loss. In particular, innovative information and communications technology (ICT) applications along the food system had been highlighted. Coupled with China's long-term efforts in investing in agriculture, building emergency response systems, and adopting governor's responsibility mechanisms, there has been little panic in the food system with largely sufficient supplies and stable prices. In the second quarter of 2020, after registered negative growth in the first quarter, primary agriculture grew by 3.4% and the negative growth of livestock production was narrowed significantly by 8.7 percentage points. Food prices rose by a modest 0.6% and returned to normal after a surge in February 2020. SIGNIFICANCE: We expect that China's experiences on building resilient food systems could improve understanding of the challenges posed by COVID-19 from a retrospective perspective and provide lessons to other countries that are experiencing disruptions in the food systems worldwide. The lessons are also important for strengthening the resilience of food systems over longer time horizons. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; COVID-19; Food system; Resilience; Responses","agricultural performance; agricultural production; COVID-19; food security; food supply; income distribution; livestock farming; logistics; state role; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101269845

The use of treated wastewater for crop irrigation is a feasible option as the agriculture sector is the largest user of all water sources. This paper provides a review of wastewater utilization for crop irrigation with a specific focus on environmental impacts. The need for wastewater irrigation and valuable fertilizer contribution from wastewater along with wastewater treatment processes are presented. The environmental impacts of wastewater irrigation on soil and plant are detailed. The effect of wastewater irrigation on human and animal health due to pathogens (bacteria, protozoa, viruses) and contaminants of emerging concern (pharmaceuticals, pesticides, personal care products) are described. The water-related vector-borne diseases (dengue fever, zika, malaria, yellow fever) are also detailed. The link between wastewater irrigation and climate and greenhouse gasses (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) emissions are discussed. And the global case studies of wastewater irrigation and their implications are described. The literature analysis revealed that poorly-treated wastewater resulted in the deposition of heavy metals and other toxic elements in soils and plants apart from raised pathogens level and increased microbial threats to human and animal wellbeing.

Employing a simulation model (MAGNET), this study examines the sustainability implications arising from the adoption of recommended daily nutrition requirements inspired by the ‘Lancet’ reference diet. To measure sustainability, changes in ‘virtual’ requirements and associated tier footprints for irrigation (blue) water, agricultural land and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are calculated. Assuming business-as-usual food consumption trends, between 2015 and 2050 blue water, agricultural land and emissions rise 34%, 9% and 44%, respectively, whilst corresponding increases in Sub-Saharan Africa are much higher. By 2050, the switch to the reference diet decreases agricultural land use by -8% and emissions by -9%. Global blue water and cropland requirements increase by 5%, whilst significant concomitant savings in permanent pastureland (-21%) are expected. By region, the diet switch drives rising blue water consumption in Oceania and the EU and agricultural land savings in Latin America and Oceania, accompanied by cropland increases in the EU and North Africa. The reference diet generates substantial reductions in GHG emissions, particularly in Latin America. Interestingly, Sub-Saharan Africa which abstains from the reference diet due to affordability considerations, benefits from a ‘rebound’ effect from falling meat and dairy prices. Finally, the diet shift could result in marginal per capita food expenditure rises arising from demand driven fish price, particularly in more vulnerable world regions. This estimate does not capture, however, second-round economic growth effects arising from increased labour productivity and reduced public health expenditures. © 2021","CGE modelling; Reference diet; Virtual commodities; Water, land and GHG footprints","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Economics; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Productivity; Sustainable development; Weaving; Agricultural land; Agricultural land use; Business-as-usual; Global sustainability; Health expenditures; Labour productivities; Sub-saharan africa; Substantial reduction; Nutrition; commodity; diet; economic growth; environmental assessment; environmental economics; expenditure; greenhouse gas; health expenditure; labor productivity; public health; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; Africa south of the Sahara; Article; carbon footprint; cropland; diet; eating habit; economic development; European Union; fluid intake; food intake; health care cost; human; North Africa; nutrient intake; nutritional health; nutritional requirement; Pacific islands; pastureland; price; productivity; public health; rebound; South and Central America; sustainable development; Europe; Latin America; Sub-Saharan Africa; Oceania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100427712

Decisive and comprehensive action is required to slow down the spread of antibiotic resistance, including increased investment in antibiotic discovery, sustainable policies that provide returns on investment for newly launched antibiotics, and public education to reduce the overusage of antibiotics, especially in livestock and agriculture. Without significant changes in the current antibiotic pipeline, we are in danger of entering a post-antibiotic era.In this Account, we summarize our recent efforts to develop next-generation streptogramin and lankacidin antibiotics that overcome bacterial resistance by means of modular chemical synthesis. First, we describe our highly modular, scalable route to four natural group A streptogramins antibiotics in 6-8 steps from seven simple chemical building blocks. We next describe the application of this route to the synthesis of a novel library of streptogramin antibiotics informed by in vitro and in vivo biological evaluation and high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy. One lead compound showed excellent inhibitory activity in vitro and in vivo against a longstanding streptogramin-resistance mechanism, virginiamycin acetyltransferase. Our results demonstrate that the combination of rational design and modular chemical synthesis can revitalize classes of antibiotics that are limited by naturally arising resistance mechanisms.Second, we recount our modular approaches toward lankacidin antibiotics. Lankacidins are a group of polyketide natural products with activity against several strains of Gram-positive bacteria but have not been deployed as therapeutics due to their chemical instability. We describe a route to several diastereomers of 2,18-seco-lankacidinol B in a linear sequence of ≤8 steps from simple building blocks, resulting in a revision of the C4 stereochemistry. We next detail our modular synthesis of several diastereoisomers of iso-lankacidinol that resulted in the structural reassignment of this natural product. These structural revisions raise interesting questions about the biosynthetic origin of lankacidins, all of which possessed uniform stereochemistry prior to these findings. Finally, we summarize the ability of several iso- and seco-lankacidins to inhibit the growth of bacteria and to inhibit translation in vitro, providing important insights into structure-function relationships for the class. ©",,"antiinfective agent; lankacidins; macrolide; streptogramin derivative; virginiamycin; volpristin; antibiotic resistance; chemistry; conformation; drug effect; Escherichia coli; Gram negative bacterium; Gram positive bacterium; metabolism; microbial sensitivity test; molecular dynamics; ribosome; synthesis; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Escherichia coli; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Gram-Positive Bacteria; Macrolides; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Molecular Conformation; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Ribosomes; Streptogramins; Virginiamycin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104919883

Therefore, assessing irrigation requirements is essential for the development of effective water-related policies for an efficient management of water resources. Moreover, global-scale analyses are becoming increasingly relevant, motivated by globalized production and international trade of food as well as by the need of common strategies to address climate change. In this study, a comprehensive model to estimate crop growth and irrigation requirements of 26 main crops at global scale is presented. The model computes a soil water balance using daily precipitation and reference evapotranspiration based on a high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis dataset from the European Copernicus Program. The irrigation requirement, defined as the minimum water volume to avoid water stress, is computed for year 2000 at the resolution of 5 arc-min (or 0.0833°) and aggregated at different spatial and temporal scales for relevant analyses. The estimated global irrigation requirements for 962 km3 is described in detail, also in relation to the spatial variability and to the monthly variation of the requirements. A focus on different areas of the world (California, Northern Italy and India) highlights the wealth of information provided by the model in different climatic conditions. National data of irrigation withdrawals have been used for an extensive comparison with model results. A crop-specific validation has also been made for the State of California, comparing model results with local data of irrigation volume and independent estimates of crop water use. In both cases, we found a good agreement between model results and real data. © 2021 Rolle et al.

However, increasing cost of irrigation water, fertilizers, labour and other inputs, and the spatio-temporal variation in actual yield, market price and profitability of rice, have added uncertainty to the sustainability of Boro rice cultivation. In this study, we evaluated the productivity, profitability, and prospect of Boro rice production using comprehensive field data collected directly from 420 farmers’ fields over two consecutive seasons (2015–16 and 2016–17), across seven geographically distributed locations in the NW region. We also analyzed the risk and return trade of popular Boro rice cultivars using Monte-Carlo simulation. The results show that there were significant (p≤0.05) variations in rice yield between sites, irrigation pump-types, and rice varieties, with Hybrid rice and BRRI dhan29 producing highest yields (6.0–7.5 t/ha). Due to different pricing systems, the cost of irrigation water varied from site to site and from year to year, but always comprised the highest input cost (20–25% of total production). The total paid-out cost, gross benefit, and gross income of rice significantly (p≤0.05) differed between sites, type of irrigation pumps, rice varieties, transplanting dates, and two cropping years. The variations in observed yield and profitability reveal considerable scope to improve rice production systems. Market variation in the price of rice affected overall profitability significantly. Probability and risk analysis results show that Minikit and BRRI dhan29 are the most stable varieties for yield and profitability. Hybrid rice, which has the maximum attainable yield among the cultivated rice varieties, also has the risk of negative net income. Based on the analysis, we discussed ways to improve yield and profitability and the prospect of Boro rice cultivation in the region. The study provides valuable information for policy-makers to sustain irrigated rice cultivation in both the NW region and nationally. © 2021 Mainuddin et al.

A global agricultural simulation model assesses changes in production, commodity prices, and trade resulting from a U.S. carbon tax. In addition, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land-use change are quantified to evaluate the possible unintended consequence of increasing emissions in the rest of the world. Three U.S. carbon tax scenarios are evaluated ranging from $15–$144 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (t−1 CO2-e) and covering a 10-year projection period. The results show that the production cost for corn and soybeans increase by a maximum of 32.6% and 22.4%, respectively at a carbon tax of $144 t−1 CO2-e. The production cost increase is compensated in part by an increase in commodity prices. Hence, the decrease in net returns for corn, soybeans, and wheat is 11.4%, 8.7%, and 11.0%, respectively, in the scenario with the highest carbon price. U.S. exports decrease for major commodities such as corn (24.9%), sorghum (20.5%), and wheat (8.7%). Barley, soybeans, and sunflower see an increase in exports of 1.2–8.8%. These changes in trade patterns also result in a re-allocation of land-use in the rest of the world leading to a slight increase in global GHG emissions from land-use change representing 1.8% of total U.S. emissions in 2017. The increase in emissions is small compared to the overall projected reduction from the carbon tax. Policy makers need to be cognizant of leakage in terms of land-use change and that measures must be taken to avoid expansion into carbon rich native vegetation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural production; Carbon leakage; Climate change policy; Global trade; International trade","agricultural market; agricultural production; carbon emission; climate change; environmental economics; environmental policy; global trade; international trade; land use change; leakage; pollution tax; United States; Glycine max; Helianthus; Hordeum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100389817

Straw return is the primary way for disposal after harvesting. However, it is controversial in the effect of corn straw return on corn yield, the optimal amount of corn straw return is still unclear. Furthermore, NEC farmers are unwilling to adopt, so these issues require comprehensive regional evaluation. To begin with, this paper studied effects of corn straw return on corn yield increase with meta-analysis. The results illustrated that corn straw return has positive effect on corn yield increase. Secondly, in order to find optimal proportions, n-fold cross-validation method was implemented, and an inventory of corn straw return on corn yield in NEC was compiled. The optimal scheme of corn straw return is 48% of corn straw could bring 5.83% corn yield increase. Finally, results from system dynamics with Monte Carlo (MC) simulation revealed that such production increase potential (around 6.1 million tons of corn) was being blocked by the unaffordable cost for farmers under ordinary scenario. Interestingly, this paper contrived an extreme scenario that corn straw return could be profitable. The flexible adjustment of subsidy could become the motivation for measurement adaptation. This paper concludes that, corn straw return is a sustainable safeguard that can promote corn production in NEC, thus to China's food security in the long run. © 2021","Corn production; Corn straw return; Meta-analysis; National food security; Northeast China (NEC)","Agriculture; Food supply; Monte Carlo methods; Corn production; Cross-validation methods; Flexible adjustment; Meta analysis; Northeast China; Optimal scheme; Production increase; System Dynamics; System theory; nitrogen; nitrogen fertilizer; soil organic matter; total nitrogen; unclassified drug; assessment method; crop production; farmers attitude; food security; maize; meta-analysis; straw; waste disposal; agricultural worker; Article; calibration; China; controlled study; decision making; environmental policy; food industry; irrigation (agriculture); limit of quantitation; Monte Carlo method; prospective study; quantitative analysis; soil acidity; waste management; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100216532

The development of regionally appropriate SI options however requires accounting for the knowledge and preferences of key stakeholders. In Bangladesh, the Government has requested international donors to support the development of dry season rice expansion in the coastal region. Policies however tend to be made without adequate study of farmers' preferences and ambitions; this can render crop intensification efforts ineffective. Understanding farmers' preferences for alternative crops and crop management practices are therefore crucial for success where agricultural development investments aim at incorporating the principles of SI. OBJECTIVE(S): Using coastal Bangladesh as a case study– we aim to (1) quantify farmers' preferences for alternative irrigated crop and crop management options in comparison to the status quo (land fallowing), (2) analyze whether farmers' preferences are conditioned by concerns regarding the cost and availability of irrigation and fertilizer inputs in comparison to expected net revenues, (3) understand how the heterogeneity in preferences can be attributed to farmer and/or farm characteristics, institutional, and biophysical factors, (4) determine how much farmers' are willing to invest in different crops and crop management options – including those reliant and not reliant on irrigation. METHODS: Taking 300 farmers in two diverse coastal environments, a choice experiment (CE) was employed to explore the heterogeneity in farmers' preferences for different dry “rabi” season intensification options (‘boro’ rice, maize, wheat and mungbean) against the status quo (dry season land fallowing after harvest of the monsoon season rice crop). Analyses included random parameter logit modeling followed by willingness-to-invest and profit simulations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Analyses revealed strong farmer preferences against rice and in favor of irrigated maize, and also in favor of rainfed or partially irrigated mungbean as an alternative to land fallowing. Irrespective of their location and environmental conditions, respondents had largely a negative preference for irrigation and fertilizer use due to high investment costs and associated production risks in the dry season. Nonetheless, a significant positive effect on their willingness-to-intensify cropping was observed where farmers felt it feasible to provide in-field drainage to limit waterlogging risks. SIGNIFICANCE: The study signifies the importance of accounting for farmers' preferences while developing context-specific SI policies. Improving agronomic investments, tenure security, market, credit and extension support are likely prerequisites, alongside targeted diffusion of stress-tolerant mungbean and maize varieties for SI in coastal Bangladesh. © 2021 The Authors","Cereal systems; Choice experiment; Ex-ante; Farmer preferences; South Asia; Sustainable intensification","agricultural development; agricultural intensification; agricultural management; coastal zone; cropping practice; dry season; farming system; irrigation system; rainfed agriculture; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100013784

For each sea region, up to five coupled biogeochemical models from institutes all over Europe were brought together for the first time. All model systems followed a harmonised scenario approach and ran two simulations, which varied only in the riverine nutrient inputs. The load reductions were evaluated with the catchment model GREEN and represented the impacts due to improved management of agriculture and wastewater treatment in all European river systems. The model ensemble, comprising 15 members, was used to assess changes to the core eutrophication indicators as defined within MSFD Descriptor 5. In nearly all marine regions, riverine load reductions led to reduced nutrient concentrations in the marine environment. However, regionally the nutrient input reductions led to an increase in the non-limiting nutrient in the water, especially in the case of phosphate concentrations in the Black Sea. Further core eutrophication indicators, such as chlorophyll-a, bottom oxygen and the Trophic Index TRIX, improved nearly everywhere, but the changes were less pronounced than for the inorganic nutrients. The model ensemble displayed strong consistency and robustness, as most if not all models indicated improvements in the same areas. There were substantial differences between the individual seas in the speed of response to the reduced nutrient loads. In the North Sea ensemble, a stable plateau was reached after only three years, while the simulation period of eight years was too short to obtain steady model results in the Baltic Sea. The ensemble exercise confirmed the importance of improved management of agriculture and wastewater treatments in the river catchments to reduce marine eutrophication. Several shortcomings were identified, the outcome of different approaches to compute the mean change was estimated and potential improvements are discussed to enhance policy support. Applying a model ensemble enabled us to obtain highly robust and consistent model results, substantially decreasing uncertainties in the scenario outcome. © Copyright © 2021 Friedland, Macias, Cossarini, Daewel, Estournel, Garcia-Gorriz, Grizzetti, Grégoire, Gustafson, Kalaroni, Kerimoglu, Lazzari, Lenhart, Lessin, Maljutenko, Miladinova, Müller-Karulis, Neumann, Parn, Pätsch, Piroddi, Raudsepp, Schrum, Stegert, Stips, Tsiaras, Ulses and Vandenbulcke.","eutrophication; lower trophic level models; model ensemble; MSFD; pan-European river management impacts; water quality indicators",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103840436

Combining the blockchain technology with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology to enhance the transparency and sustainability of agricultural supply chains, has attracted researchers from both academia and industry. This paper reviews the latest applications of the blockchain and IoT technologies in the sustainable agricultural supply chain management and explores the design and implementation of a blockchain-based sustainable solution. By placing the sustainable agricultural supply chain management at its core, a blockchain-based framework is designed. Considering the heterogeneity of the transaction data and the IoT data, the openness of sustainability information and the sensitivity of participants' data, a double-chain structure is proposed including the consensus method, the transaction mechanisms, the sustainability assessment method and the performance optimization strategy. The sustainable management practices of all participants are introduced into the blockchain network, especially those allowing the government to play a more signicant role in agriculture supply management. Meanwhile, to meet the scenario requirements, a data reduction method is designed to improve performance and reduce block size. Simulations are performed to evaluate the latency, throughput, costs and efciency of the proposed structure.

As part of this transformation, most farmer receipts are paid independently of production, granting this class of payment production-neutral or ‘fully decoupled’ status. In prospective agricultural market studies, simulation models routinely represent these payments as decoupled, despite academic evidence to the contrary that posits a number of ‘coupling-channels’. To explore the ramifications of differing degrees of coupling on the three pillars of sustainability, a natural-resources focused simulation model is employed. Comparing with a ‘standard’ decoupled baseline to 2030, higher coupling increases global agricultural employment and reduces production intensity on European Union agricultural land and agricultural emissions. Higher coupling also diminishes the Common Agricultural Policy’s capacity as a safety-net for European Union food-security and agricultural employment, whilst there is tentative evidence of increasing emissions ‘leakage’. At the very least, if the non-distorting status of decoupled payments is mis-specified, this has direct implications for the design of greener policy initiatives under the auspices of the Green Deal that promote sustainable fairer trade. As a result, further empirical research on the production distorting effects of the European Union’s decoupled payments is needed. © 2021 by the authors.

Water and energy resources are the supporting basis of food production, and the production and use of energy also need to consume a large amount of water resources. The three affect each other and are interdependent. Paying attention to the synergistic security of water-energy-food system in the Yangtze River Economic Belt is important for regional economic development. This paper uses the pressure-state-response (PSR) model and selects 27 indicators to build an evaluation index system of the regional water-energyfood system. We use the random forest model to evaluate the security level of the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2008 to 2017, and the Haken model is employed to identify the driving factors that dominate the synergistic evolution of the system. Then we take the identified factors as the key control variables under each scenario and launch a scenario simulation of some provinces in the Yangtze River Economic Belt in 2025. The results show that due to the improvement of water and energy utilization efficiency and the advancement of agricultural production technology, the level of water-energy-food security in the Yangtze River Economic Belt improved significantly from 2008 to 2017. Each province performs differently in different subsystems, with water resources security being better in the upper reaches and Zhejiang and Shanghai in the lower reaches, and food security being better in the middle and lower reaches. The level of energy security is high in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou in the upper reaches and Shanghai and Anhui in the lower reaches. According to the results of scenario prediction for Jiangsu Province and Hubei Province in 2025, implementing moderate management in accordance with current management objectives can increase the overall security of the system to level 4. The two provinces should focus on controlling water resources and energy consumption and improving the utilization efficiency of water and energy in agricultural production. © 2021 by the authors.","Random forest-haken model (RF-haken); Scenario prediction; Security evaluation; Water-energy-food; Yangtze river economic belt","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Decision trees; Economics; Energy security; Energy utilization; Food supply; Regional planning; Agricultural productions; Evaluation index system; Management objectives; Pressure state response (PSR); Random forest modeling; Regional economic development; Utilization efficiency; Water resources securities; Rivers; agricultural production; economic analysis; food security; numerical model; prediction; simulation; water resource; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102661409

In this context, urban and peri-urban agriculture can play a crucial role, mainly if associated with an agroecological approach. Indeed, the extensive use of living fences and tree rows can improve the environmental quality, assuring ecosystem services (ES), developing a sustainable urban food system and increasing local productions and the related socio-economic improvements. This study aims to assess the benefits of an agroecological requalification of a dismissed peri-urban area in the South Milan Agricultural Regional Park (Italy), by evaluating two possible scenarios, both involving planting trees and shrubs in that area. The software I-Tree Eco simulates the ecosystem services provision of planting new hedgerows, evaluating the benefits over 30 years. The study underlines the difference between the two scenarios and how the planted area becomes an essential supplier of regulating ecosystem services for the neighbourhoods, increasing carbon storage and air pollution removal. Results were then analysed with a treemap, to better investigate and understand the relationship between the different ecosystem services, showing a notable increase in carbon sequestration at the end of the simulation (at year 30). The study shows a replicable example of a methodology and techniques that can be used to assess the ES in urban and peri-urban environments. © 2021 by the authors.

Understanding the patterns of LULC change assists in managing natural resources effectively, especially for regions where there are minimal or no reported data on the status of LULC. In this study, remotely sensed Landsat satellite imagery from 5 years (i.e., 1988, 1996, 2002, 2008, and 2017), geographic information systems (GIS), and the hybrid cellular automata (CA)-Markov model were used to (i) quantify the past and present LULC changes and (ii) model the future changes in Sulaimani Province in the Kurdistan region of Iraq (KRI). To accomplish these objectives, five LULC maps with various class categories were generated using the maximum likelihood classifier (MCL). The classified maps for 1996, 2002, 2008, and 2017 were used in the hybrid model to simulate LULC maps for 2017 and 2037. The map simulated for 2017 was validated with the classified 2017 LULC map. The change analysis demonstrated that between 1988 and 2017, the built-up areas and agricultural fallow land increased by 419% and 226%, respectively. In the future predictions for 2037, built-up areas and agricultural fallow land showed increasing trends of 5.5% and 26.5%, respectively. In contrast, agricultural land, plantation land, and sparse vegetation areas were predicted to decrease by 29.4%, 65.8%, and 36.9%, respectively. In addition, in 2008, waterbodies shrank by 43.36% in comparison with their status in 1988, suggesting that 2008 was a severe drought year. These findings provide invaluable baseline information with which conservation biologists, agricultural engineers, urban planners, and decision makers can better manage natural resources and monitor environmental changes. Based on these results, sustainable development actions and an early warning system can be established. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.","CA-Markov; GIS; Iraq; Landsat data; LULC; Modeling","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Cellular automata; Conservation; Decision making; Land use; Markov processes; Maximum likelihood; Planning; Satellite imagery; Sustainable development; Early Warning System; Environmental change; Hybrid cellular automatons; Kurdistan Region of Iraq; Land use and land cover change; Land use/land cover; Maximum likelihood classifiers; Multitemporal satellites; Information management; cellular automaton; GIS; land cover; land use change; Landsat; Markov chain; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; agricultural land; article; biologist; cellular automaton; classifier; drought; environmental change; geographic information system; human; human experiment; Iraqi Kurdistan; Markov chain; maximum likelihood method; natural resource; plantation; prediction; quantitative analysis; satellite imagery; simulation; sustainable development; urban area; vegetation; agriculture; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; Iraq; satellite imagery; Iraq; Kurdistan [Iraq]; Indicator indicator; Varanidae; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Iraq; Satellite Imagery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101834203

A few countries, mostly in high latitudes, may experience gains, while most will see average yield decrease. This paper aims to quantify the role of market-mediated adjustments in attenuating the effects of climate change by allowing the expression of the new climate-induced pattern of comparative advantages within and between countries. To do this, we develop a quantitative general equilibrium trade model where the representation of land use choice is inspired from modern Ricardian trade models. We use spatially explicit information from the agronomic literature about potential yields before and after climate change for calibration and counterfactual simulations.

While measures to improve air quality in megacities such as Delhi are typically aimed at reducing levels of particulate matter (PM), ozone could become a greater threat if these measures focus on PM alone, as some air pollution mitigation steps can actually lead to an increase in surface ozone. A better understanding of the factors controlling ozone production in Delhi and the impact that PM mitigation measures have on ozone is therefore critical for improving air quality. Here, we combine in situ observations and model analysis to investigate the impact of PM reduction on the non-linear relationship between volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone. In situ measurements of NOx, VOC, and ozone were conducted in Delhi during the APHH-India programme in summer (June) and winter (November) 2018. We observed hourly averaged ozone concentrations in the city of up to 100 ppbv in both seasons. We performed sensitivity simulations with a chemical box model to explore the impacts of PM on the non-linear VOC-NOx-ozone relationship in each season through its effect on aerosol optical depth (AOD). We find that ozone production is limited by VOC in both seasons, and is particularly sensitive to solar radiation in winter. Reducing NOx alone increases ozone, such that a 50% reduction in NOx emissions leads to 10-50% increase in surface ozone. In contrast, reducing VOC emissions can reduce ozone efficiently, such that a 50% reduction in VOC emissions leads to ∼60% reduction in ozone. Reducing PM alone also increases ozone, especially in winter, by reducing its dimming effects on photolysis, such that a 50% reduction in AOD can increase ozone by 25% and it also enhances VOC-limitation. Our results highlight the importance of reducing VOC emissions alongside PM to limit ozone pollution, as well as benefitting control of PM pollution through reducing secondary organic aerosol. This will greatly benefit the health of citizens and the local ecosystem in Delhi, and could have broader application for other megacities characterized by severe PM pollution and VOC-limited ozone production.

In this study, geostatistical analysis, a material balance linear model, and an environmental load capacity method were selected to simulate the environmental capacities of eight heavy metals (Hg, As, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn and Cd) in the agricultural land of north Zhongshan City. Then, based on the capacity data in 2015 as the baseline year, risk early warning assessment was carried out, and the management strategy of soil heavy metal pollution under the goal of “soil security” was proposed accordingly. The results showed that between 2015 and 2035, there was a 1.73-fold increase in the average annual capacity of heavy metals in the soil samples collected in the study area. Generally, the heavy metal environmental capacities showed an upward trend, except for Hg, and the low capacity areas were primarily distributed in the northern plain. The comprehensive risk level was medium, based on the soil heavy metal environmental capacities. Further, the average environmental capacity indexes of Hg, As, Cr, and Pb were all >1, corresponding to no risk. However, those of Ni and Zn were 0.8 and 0.7, which corresponded to mild risk, while those of Cu and Cd were all <0, corresponding to extreme risk. Additionally, it is necessary for the government to consider the main pollution sources when formulating targeted measures aimed at controlling agricultural land heavy metal pollution in industrial cities. The results of this study provide theoretical contributions on early warning of risks related to heavy metal environmental capacity of the agricultural land in industrial cities, and serve as practical reference for speeding up the formulation of agricultural land pollution management policies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Early warning; Environmental capacity; Soil safety; Spatiotemporal simulation; Zhongshan city","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Heavy metals; Pollution; Soils; Comprehensive risks; Environmental capacity; Environmental loads; Geostatistical analysis; Heavy metal pollution; Management strategies; Policy recommendations; Spatio-temporal simulation; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095732988

We tested the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for Nigeria from 1981 to 2014. We applied the novel dynamic autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) simulations to develop conceptual tools for policy formulation. The empirical results confirmed the EKC hypothesis and found that agricultural innovation and energy utilization have an escalation effect on CO2 emissions whereas income and biocapacity have long-run emission-reduction effects. The causality results found agricultural innovation attributable to CO2 emissions and observed that income drives energy demand. Income, biocapacity, and energy utilization are found to predict changes in CO2 emissions. These results are validated by the innovation accounting techniques—wherein 22.79% of agricultural innovation corresponds to 49.43% CO2 emissions—5.95% of biocapacity has 35.78% attributable CO2 emissions—and 1.61% of energy spurs CO2 emissions by 16.27%.

Agri-production has undergone a significant transformation from traditional practices to precise practices with the help of new technologies such as the IoT, big data, and GIS. However, the impact of such precision on the overall supply chain is insufficient due to the low adaptability of these expensive technologies. Fuzzy logic, known for being able to handle uncertainty in different fields of science and technology, may be able to address the highly uncertain factors of the agri-supply chain, such as the soil content, rainfall, humidity, and production and yield prediction. Thus, this study reviews fuzzy applications in the agri-supply chain considering land suitability, production techniques, irrigation, cold storage deficiencies, transportation, waste management, environmental and sustainability issues, and drought management and establishes an integrated framework. The integrated framework, which aims to analyse the overall supply chain performance, finally concludes that there is a lack of efficient knowledge-based models in the domain. Thus, using collaborative fuzzy applications with big data and GIS with a higher degree of heuristic and meta-heuristic simulations in the agri-supply chain can develop more robust models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agri-supply chain issues; Agriculture; Fuzzy logic; Systematic literature review","Big data; Cold storage; Digital storage; Fuzzy logic; Knowledge based systems; Metadata; Sustainable development; Waste management; Drought management; Integrated frameworks; Knowledge-based model; Literature reviews; Production techniques; Science and Technology; Supply chain performance; Sustainability issues; Supply chains",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093972612

Understanding how to balance the discrepancy between economic and social water use and ecological water use is an urgent problem to be solved, especially in arid areas. The Heihe River is the second-largest inland river in China, and this problem is notable. To ensure the downstream ecological water use, the “Water Distribution Plan for the Mainstream of the Heihe River” (97 Water Diversion Scheme) controls the discharge of Yingluo Gorge and Zhengyi Gorge, while the “Opinions of applying the strictest water resources control system” (Three Red Lines) restricts the water use. With the development of the economy and agriculture in the midstream, Zhengyi Gorge’s discharge cannot reach the Heihe River’s ecological water downstream. This paper is under the constraints of the “97 Water Diversion Scheme” of Heihe River and the “Three Red Lines” of the total water use control index for Zhangye County. We constructed a water resource allocation model for the midstream of Heihe River to reasonably allocate water resources in the Heihe River’s midstream and downstream. This model is divided into three parts: Establish the mathematical equation, simulate the water consumption under the different inflow conditions, and ensure each water user’s demand. The result showed that if we fail to confine total water consumption in the midstream, through the reasonable allocation of water resources, the real water use and water consumption of the middle Heihe River will be greater than the “97 Water Diversion Scheme” and the “Three Red Lines.” If we confine water consumption, they will be within the “97 Water Diversion Scheme” and the “Three Red Lines,” at the same time, they can reach the downstream of the Heihe River’s ecological water. Besides, under the premise of satisfying the economic water and ecological water downstream of the Heihe River, returning farmland to wasteland and strengthening water-saving measures will improve water efficiency and be more conducive to allocating water resources. © 2021 by the authors.

These models, however, capture just some of the processes that will shape future nutrition. We adopt an alternative standpoint, developing an agent-based model in which producer-consumer smallholders practice different ‘styles of farming’ in the global food system. The model represents a hypothetical rural community in which ‘orphan’ (subsistence) farmers may develop by adopting an ‘entrepreneurial’ style (highly market-dependent) or by maintaining a ‘peasant’ style (agroecology). We take a first look at the question: how might patterns of farming styles—under various style preference, climate, policy, and price transmission scenarios—impact on hunger and health-supporting conditions (incomes, work, inequality, ‘real land productivity’) in rural areas? imulations without climate change or agricultural policy found that style preference patterns influence production, food price, and incomes, and there were trade-offs between them. For instance, entrepreneurial-oriented futures had the highest production and lowest prices but were simultaneously those in which farms tended towards crisis. Simulations with climate change and agricultural policy found that peasant-orientated agroecology futures had the highest production, prices equal to or lower than those under entrepreneurial-oriented futures, and better supported rural health. There were, however, contradictory effects on nutrition, with benefits and harms for different groups. Collectively the findings suggest that when attempting to understand how climate change may impact on future nutrition and health, patterns of farming styles—along with the fates of the households that practice them—matter. These issues, including the potential role of peasant farming, have been neglected in previous global-level climate-nutrition modelling but go to the heart of current debates on the future of farming: thus, they should be given more prominence in future work. © 2021 Lloyd, Chalabi.

We use a participatory modelling tool, Kesho, to assess the biophysical, socioeconomic, cultural and governance factors that influenced past (1959–1999) and present (2000–2018) LULCC in northern Tanzania and to simulate four scenarios of land cover change to the year 2030. Simulations of the scenarios used spatial modelling to integrate stakeholders’ perceptions of future environmental change with social and environmental data on recent trends in LULCC. From stakeholders’ perspectives, between 1959 and 2018, LULCC was influenced by climate variability, availability of natural resources, agriculture expansion, urbanization, tourism growth and legislation governing land access and natural resource management. Among other socio-environmental-political LULCC drivers, the stakeholders envisioned that from 2018 to 2030 LULCC will largely be influenced by land health, natural and economic capital, and political will in implementing land use plans and policies. The projected scenarios suggest that by 2030 agricultural land will have expanded by 8–20% under different scenarios and herbaceous vegetation and forest land cover will be reduced by 2.5–5% and 10–19% respectively. Stakeholder discussions further identified desirable futures in 2030 as those with improved infrastructure, restored degraded landscapes, effective wildlife conservation, and better farming techniques. The undesirable futures in 2030 were those characterized by land degradation, poverty, and cultural loss. Insights from our work identify the implications of future LULCC scenarios on wildlife and cultural conservation and in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets by 2030.

The modeling system consists of coupled and interrelated models, including (i) a surface hydrology model (UTHBAL), (ii) a groundwater hydrology model (MODFLOW), (iii) a crop growth/nitrate leaching model (REPIC, an R-ArcGIS-based EPIC model), (iv) a groundwater contaminant transport model (MT3DMS), and (v) a groundwater seawater intrusion model (SEAWAT). The efficacy of the modeling system to simulate the quantity and quality of water resources has been applied to the Almyros basin in Thessaly, Greece. It is a coastal agricultural basin with irrigated and intensified agriculture facing serious groundwater problems, such as groundwater depletion, nitrate pollution, and seawater intrusion. Irrigation demands were estimated for the main crops cultivated in the area, based on precipitation and temperature from regional weather stations. The models have been calibrated and validated against time-series of observed crop yields, groundwater table observations, and observed concentrations of nitrates and chlorides. The results indicate that the modeling system simulates the water resources quantity and quality with increased accuracy. The proposed modeling system could be used as a tool for the simulation of water resources management and climate change scenarios. © 2021 by the authors.

Previous studies have predicted the evolution of different resource utilizations under the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), but it is still unclear whether total water use has a rebound effect. This study uses the SSPs as the basic prediction framework and evaluates the water resources and economic status of the provinces in China using the hydro-economic (HE) classification method. Then, combined with the SSPs scenario setting parameters, the conditional convergence model and the method recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) are used to simulate the changes in water use efficiency of the different provinces in China under different scenarios. Based on the future GDP forecast data of China’s provinces, combined with the forecast of water use efficiency changes, the total water use changes in China’s 31 provinces under different pathways from 2016 to 2030 are calculated. Among them, the future GDP data is predicted based on the Cobb-Douglas production function and SSPs scenario settings. Using a comprehensive evaluation of the evolution of the efficiency and the total amount, this study reveals whether there is a rebound effect. The results showed that with the continuous growth in the water use efficiency, the total water use had a “U” type trend, which indicated that there was a rebound effect in the total water use of China under the different SSPs. Based on this information, this study proposes some suggestions for irrigation water-saving technologies and policies. © 2021 by the authors.","Rebound effect; Shared socioeconomic pathways; Total water use; Water use efficiency","convergence; Gross Domestic Product; prediction; socioeconomic status; water resource; water use efficiency; Article; China; classification; economic status; forecasting; gross national product; model; prediction; simulation; socioeconomics; trend study; water and water related phenomena; water supply; agriculture; socioeconomics; water supply; China; water; Agriculture; China; Socioeconomic Factors; Water; Water Resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100478384

However, the investigation using a single measure with multi-scenarios for the long-term simulation in karst agricultural watershed is still lacking. In this study, the Annualized Agricultural Non-Point Source Pollution (AnnAGNPS) model was developed to verify the applicability in a karst agricultural watershed. Then, the model was used to determine the best management measures (BMPs) and the reduction rate characteristics under long-term effects (about 10 years) in the watershed. The AnnAGNPS model perform well in simulating in NPS pollution with R2 (0.95 for runoff, 0.93 for TN, and 0.93 for TP, respectively) and NSE (0.95 for runoff, 0.53 for TN, and 0.57 for TP, respectively). The output of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) primarily occurred in the rainy season (up to 80%). The loss of mass of TN and TP were mainly observed in orchards and woodlands in the upstream of each sub-basin. The results from AnnAGNPS model demonstrated that different BMPs had significant impacts on the reduction of NPS pollution. Furthermore, a same BMPs measure showed it was closely related to land use in the watershed. In the Qifeng River watershed, stubble tillage (ST) showed to be useful with relatively good reduction rates (16.64% for sediment, 17.85% for TN, and 17.80% for TP, respectively). The simulation results indicated that AnnAGNPS was a valuable tool after validation for the planning and management of the watershed in karst areas. © 2021 IWA Publishing.

To date, there are several land suitability analysis (LSA) methods, but there is no consensus on the best method for crop suitability analysis. We conducted a scoping review to evaluate methodological strategies for LSA. Secondary to this, we assessed which of these would be suitable for neglected and underutilised crop species (NUS). The review classified LSA methods reported in articles as traditional (26.6%) and modern (63.4%). Modern approaches, including multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods such as analytical hierarchy process (AHP) (14.9%) and fuzzy methods (12.9%); crop simulation models (9.9%) and machine learning related methods (25.7%) are gaining popularity over traditional methods. The MCDM methods, namely AHP and fuzzy, are commonly applied to LSA while crop models and machine learning related methods are gaining popularity. A total of 67 parameters from climatic, hydrology, soil, socio-economic and landscape properties are essential in LSA. Unavailability and the inclusion of categorical datasets from social sources is a challenge. Using big data and Internet of Things (IoT) improves the accuracy and reliability of LSA methods. The review expects to provide researchers and decision-makers with the most robust methods and standard parameters required in developing LSA for NUS. Qualitative and quantitative approaches must be integrated into unique hybrid land evaluation systems to improve LSA. © 2021 by the authors.

In recent past decades, water already has become a significant limiting factor for the natural environment and many agro-economic sectors in the southern Carpathian Basin. Therefore, there are increasing attempts to develop monitoring systems to detect water stress. In this study, changes in soil moisture conditions were monitored within two Arenosol profiles of extreme water balance during years characterised by different hydrologic conditions and under the impact of irrigation in the Great Hungarian Plain. Hourly data series of hydrometeorological parameters and soil moisture from six different soil depths during 2014–2018 were provided by on-site monitoring stations; humus, carbonate content, porosity, field capacity and wilting point were measured in the laboratory. On the basis of the newly definied so-called ‘available water percent’ (AW%) and a developed classification method, the rate, time and duration of water-shortage periods were evaluated for the years 2014–2018. The results show that drought monitoring cannot be effective without investigation of soil moisture content. Detailed analysis of available water percentage (AW%) can be used for real-time drought monitoring and as a precise indicator of the evolution of drought. This can help us prevent and manage damage from drought, and it is extremely important for agriculture. © 2021, The Author(s).","Available water; Drought; Monitoring; Soil moisture","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate models; Drought; Moisture control; Soil moisture; Water management; Agricultural water management; Available water contents; Classification methods; Drought monitoring; Hydrologic conditions; Moisture conditions; Natural environments; Regional climate model simulation; Soil surveys; assessment method; drought; extreme event; predation; sandy soil; soil moisture; water budget; water management; Carpathian Basin; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099966643

The changes of the quantity, quality, and spatial distribution of cropland will directly affect the crop potential yields, so it is very crucial to simulate future cropland distribution and predict crop potential yields to ensure the future food security. In the present study, the Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov model was employed to simulate land-use changes in Northeast China during 2015–2050. Then, the Global Agro-ecological Zones (GAEZ) model was used to predict maize potential yields in Northeast China in 2050, and the spatio-temporal changes of maize potential yields during 2015–2050 were explored. The results were the following. (1) The woodland and grassland decreased by 5.13 million ha and 1.74 million ha respectively in Northeast China from 2015 to 2050, which were mainly converted into unused land. Most of the dryland was converted to paddy field and built-up land. (2) In 2050, the total maize potential production and average potential yield in Northeast China were 218.09 million tonnes and 6880.59 kg/ha. Thirteen prefecture-level cities had maize potential production of more than 7 million tonnes, and 11 cities had maize potential yields of more than 8000 kg/ha. (3) During 2015–2050, the total maize potential production and average yield decreased by around 23 million tonnes and 700 kg/ha in Northeast China, respectively. (4) The maize potential production increased in 15 cities located in the plain areas over the 35 years. The potential yields increased in only nine cities, which were mainly located in the Sanjiang Plain and the southeastern regions. The results highlight the importance of coping with the future land-use changes actively, maintaining the balance of farmland occupation and compensation, improving the cropland quality, and ensuring food security in Northeast China. © 2021 by the authors.

This article provides a theoretical model of the role played by the interplay of descriptive and injunctive social norms in farmers’ decisions. When they choose to contribute voluntarily to an environmental public good, farmers may be driven by descriptive norms akin to conformity (do as the majority of their peers) as well as by injunctive norms (in line with what society expects them to do), which are the equivalent of a social injunction to act in favour of the environment. The interactions between these two social norms can yield multiple equilibria, depending on the relative weight of the descriptive norm (sensitivity to conformism) and of the injunctive norm (sensitivity to moral pressure) in the utility functions of farmers. More generally, our model can explain why social groups are sometimes trapped in low public-good-contribution equilibria, even when public subsidies to contributors are high.

Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the future changes in land use and land cover of the advancement of agriculture in the native vegetation areas of the Cerrado/Atlantic forest ecotone in the Prata River basin in 2033, 2050, 2080 and 2100. To map the future land use and land cover (LULC) in the study area, an object-based classification approach was used on Landsat satellite imagery from 1986, 1999, 2007 and 2016. The future LULC scenarios were created with a cellular automata-Markov forecast model. The simulation results of the LULC changes were considered satisfactory, as evidenced by the values obtained from the kappa for agreement (κstandard) = 0.73, kappa for no information (κno) = 0.79 and kappa for grid-cell level location (κlocation) = 0.85 indices. The modeled future scenarios of LULC indicated the advancement of crop agriculture and decreases in wetlands (banhado), savannahs, riparian forests, seasonal semideciduous forests and wet grasslands, which can be considered a warning about the loss of biodiversity of fauna and flora in the Serra da Bodoquena National Park, mainly in the Prata River basin. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Brazilian Savanna; Future scenario modeling; LULC prediction; Remote sensing","forest dynamics; forest management; land use planning; numerical model; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092485772

Organic farming is a potential way to reduce environmental impacts by excluding synthetic pesticides and fertilizers from the process. Despite ecological benefits, it is unlikely that conversion to organic can be financially viable for farmers, without additional support and incentives from consumers. This study models the interplay between consumer preferences and socio-environmental issues related to agriculture and food production. We operationalize the novel concept of extended agro-food supply chain and simulate adaptive behavior of farmers, food processors, retailers, and customers. Not only the operational factors (e.g., price, quantity, and lead time), but also the behavioral factors (e.g., attitude, perceived control, social norms, habits, and personal goals) of the food suppliers and consumers are considered in order to foster organic farming. We propose an integrated approach combining agent-based, discrete-event, and system dynamics modeling for a case of wine supply chain. Findings demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed model over the traditional sustainable supply chain models in incorporating the feedback between consumers and producers and analyzing management scenarios that can urge farmers to expand organic agriculture. Results further indicate that demand-side participation in transition pathways towards sustainable agriculture can become a time-consuming effort if not accompanied by the middle actors between consumers and farmers. In practice, our proposed model may serve as a decision-support tool to guide evidence-based policymaking in the food and agriculture sector. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental behavior; Multi-agent systems; Organic food; Supply chain management; Sustainability","Agricultural robots; Chemical contamination; Decision support systems; Discrete event simulation; Environmental impact; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; Decision support tools; Demand side participations; Environmental pollutions; Management scenarios; Sustainable agriculture; Sustainable supply chains; System dynamics model; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087932321

Calcium-fortified foods could improve calcium intake. However, there is limited calcium fortification experience, with technical and practical issues that may hamper its adoption. The objective of this landscape review is to summarize these issues to help policymakers guide the planning and design of calcium fortification as a public health strategy. One challenge is the low bioavailability of calcium salts (∼20–40%); thus, large amounts need to be added to food to have a meaningful impact. Solubility is important when fortifying liquids and acidic foods. Calcium salts could change the flavor, color, and appearance of the food and may account for 70–90% of the total fortification cost. Safety is key to avoid exceeding the recommended intake; so the amount of added calcium should be based on the target calcium intake and the gap between inadequate and adequate levels. Monitoring includes the quality of the fortified food and population calcium intake using dietary assessment methods. Calcium fortification should follow regulations, implemented in an intersectorial way, and be informed by the right to health and equity.

This study aims to predict concentrations of chlortetracycline (CTC) generated from slurry pit and evaluate its ecological risk in soil based on the European Medicine Agency guidelines by considering slurry pit farm practices such as cleaning water volume and those uncertainties. Additionally, sensitivity analysis was conducted on the exposure estimation of CTC in soil employing the Monte Carlo simulation. The predicted environmental concentrations of CTC in the slurry pit and soil were in a range of 0.54–5.64 mg/kgmanure and 3.42–67.59 μg/kgsoil, respectively, for a 90 % confidence level. The predicted ranges included the measured values reported in previous studies. The probability of risk quotient (RQ) exceeding one was estimated at 9.3 % based on the Monte Carlo simulation. The four most influential factors on the exposure to CTC in soil were identified as nitrogen in fertilizer/compost, cleaning water volume, ratio of sick pigs requiring antibiotics, and pit emptying cycles. The results indicate that the ecological risk of CTC in the soil is possible and can be controlled by slurry pit farm practices. © 2020 The Authors","Ecological hazard; Livestock manure; Monte Carlo simulation; Risk assessment; Veterinary antibiotics","Agriculture; Antibiotics; Mammals; Manures; Monte Carlo methods; Nitrogen fertilizers; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Soils; Temperature control; Concentration estimations; Exposure estimation; Influential factors; Livestock farming; Predicted environmental concentrations; Probability of risks; Risk probabilities; Veterinary antibiotic; Risk perception; chlortetracycline; fertilizer; nitrogen; antiinfective agent; agricultural application; antibiotics; assessment method; concentration (composition); environmental risk; estimation method; livestock farming; manure; risk factor; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis; agricultural slurry; anaerobic digestion; Article; biodegradation; cleaning; degradation; EC50; effluent; environmental impact assessment; microbial activity; Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; pig farming; practice guideline; sensitivity analysis; soil; swine manure; agricultural land; agriculture; animal; manure; pig; uncertainty; Suidae; Agriculture; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Chlortetracycline; Farms; Manure; Soil; Swine; Uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091116402

However, agricultural expansion is an important driver of global natural ecosystem degradation, including wetlands. Economic theory shows that wetland loss is caused by a mismatch between the private wetland conservation costs borne by landowners and the public benefits generated. We develop a spatially explicit wetland management model to estimate the private economic benefit of wetland drainage in an agricultural landscape in Alberta, Canada. We estimate a full wetland supply curve and show that the private economic benefits of wetland drainage are highly heterogeneous within a watershed. We then combine these private costs of wetland conservation with non-monetary measures of public ecosystem benefits to assess four wetland conservation policy targeting scenarios. We find a positive correlation between the opportunity cost of wetland conservation on private landowners and the amount of environmental benefits wetlands offer, suggesting that conserving the wetlands that impose the lowest opportunity cost may not be optimal targets for wetland conservation policy. We contribute to wetland conservation economics by demonstrating that targeted wetland conservation policies can be more effective than a uniform conservation policy that assumes wetlands within agricultural landscapes have the same costs and benefits. © 2021 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society","farm-simulation model; policy targeting; wetland conservation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120912040

This study explores direct observation of the impact of soil and climate factors on crop and livestock livelihood systems in the three major agro-ecological zones of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. It also analyzed their influence on small farmers’ choices of agrarian livelihood activities and the lessons learned for the suitability of agro-ecologically integrated agriculture as part of agrarian and food security reforms needed among small farming households in rural communities of South Africa. The impact of soil and rainfall on the crop and livestock livelihood choices of smallholders in the three major agro-ecological zones were explored. A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 223 smallholding farming households during the harvesting period of rain-fed farming season. Data on household livelihood activities were processed in monetary terms and subjected to gross margin and cost/benefit analysis. Geographic information system (GIS) mapping and statistical analysis were used to determine the association of smallholder maize revenue with agro-climatic variation. The results indicated that crop-based activities performed better in the Grassland zone, while livestock activities performed better in the Savanna zone. Small farms in the Karoo can only productively engage in livestock production. The results also showed that farming activities that combined more vegetable crops yielded greater profits than other field crops. Furthermore, the results indicate that the mixed cropping method remains one of the strategies for breaking-even and risk-bearing effort used by the smallholder farmers considering its cost-sharing benefits. Geographical information system (GIS) mapping further indicates that smallholders’ farming activity was not only affected by soil-climatic factors but by their management skills as well. We recommend agro-ecologically adapted policies and incentives for agriculture-based livelihood activities and intensified mixing of cropping systems among the smallholder farming households in the study area. © 2021.

The increasing complexity of policies affecting the agri-food sector requires improving the capacities of current models, connecting or redesigning them to deliver forward-looking insights on policy objectives. The EU-Project ‘Support for Policy Relevant Modelling of Agriculture' (SUPREMA) has identified upcoming needs in the research and policy agenda, while exploring the feasibility of those potential modelling exercises by testing the existing tools. The assessment has pointed out necessities for model extensions and development of new tools. Besides, it has revealed the potential of model integration and collaboration to supplement the outcomes of individual models. This is supported in view of the food system approach that is becoming the fundamental framework for analysing the dynamics of the agri-food sector when considering it from a broad perspective. This paper describes shortly how the assessment was conducted and presents the outcomes and lessons learnt from the project.

The modelling community is determined to put forward a reliable near-term climate forecasting system, to predict annual to decadal state and variability of climate. However, deriving reliable information from the decadal prediction/hindcast is still a challenge. This study examines the decadal hindcast simulations of surface air temperature (SAT) over India in seven different ocean–atmosphere coupled models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Each decadal hindcast is available for the next 10-years period from the initialized climate states of 1961–2006. The performance of models is assessed using different evaluation metrics, such as absolute mean difference, root mean square error, skill score and uncertainty in terms of the range of hindcasts. The multimodel ensemble mean displayed considerable skill in representing the spatial distribution of SAT over the Indian region except over the western Himalaya and Northeast India. Our results indicate that the decadal hindcasts skills improved noticeably when quantile mapping (QM) approach is used for the bias corrections.

Affected by many factors, agricultural production is subject to catastrophe risks from time to time. Agricultural production is mainly faced with two major threats, natural disaster risk and market risk. As an effective risk management tool, the production and promotion of agricultural insurance have played an essential role in guaranteeing the development of the agricultural industry in some developed countries and major agricultural countries in the world. This article combines the Internet of Things and Markov model for agricultural insurance risk management. First, we combine the structure of the Internet of Things and select relevant statistical data. Then, we build a panel data system, starting from two perspectives in different regions and analyze agricultural insurance's current development and characteristics at each stage. In addition, we use the Markov model to build a panel data model to explore the specific impact mechanisms deeply. We also study the effects of disaster risk levels in different regions on the development of agricultural insurance. After simulation verification, we believe that this model can effectively promote the balanced regional development of agricultural insurance. © 2021 Wei Chen and Yuansheng Jiang.",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Combines; Disasters; Insurance; Internet of things; Markov processes; Regional planning; Agricultural industries; Agricultural productions; Developed countries; Natural disaster risk; Panel data models; Regional development; Simulation verification; Statistical datas; Risk management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114616886

As one of the agricultural production trusteeship modes, the whole process trusteeship is suitable for the actual situation of China's aging population and labor force transfer. This paper aims to construct an evolutionary game model containing multistakeholder to explore the behavior decisions through numerical simulation and to provide useful suggestions for the formation of a positive and stable trusteeship relationship and the sound development of the whole process trusteeship of agricultural production. Design/methodology/approach: The paper incorporates village committees, service organizations and farmers into the same research framework, selects “guarantee + dividends” as the income distribution method and applies the evolutionary game method to analyze behavioral choices and evolutionary paths of stakeholders. By constructing the expectation function, establishing the replicator dynamic equations and analyzing the tripartite evolutionary stability strategy, the authors explore the factors that affect the stakeholders’ strategy choice and determine asymptotically stable points and stability conditions. Findings: (1) There is a game relationship among village committees, farmers and service organizations in the whole process trusteeship of agricultural production, asymptotically stable points (0,0,1) and (1,1,1) are obtained through calculation. (2) The proportion of stakeholders' strategy choice, the weight of the whole process trusteeship of agricultural production in the performance appraisal of the village committee, the village committee's supervision cost, the village committee's reputation effect and the penalty for false dividends of the service organization will affect the speed at which the curve representing the tripartite relationship approaches two asymptotically stable points. Research limitations/implications: The countermeasures proposed in the paper have excellent reference value. (1) For areas that have realized the project: Village committees can solve the trusteeship problems exposed in the initial areas and improve farmers' satisfaction with the project. (2) For areas that have not realized the project: Those regions will receive more experience references and enhance their confidence in this project. The limitation of the paper is that it takes the main grain-producing areas in only the three northeastern provinces of China as the research object. The next research object will be extended to the whole country. Practical implications: This paper propose strategies for realizing the orderly operation of the whole process trusteeship of agricultural production: first, increase the proportion of stakeholders' strategy choices; second, reduce the village committee's supervision cost; third, increase the weight of the whole process trusteeship of agricultural production in the performance appraisal of the village committee; fourth, improve the village committee's reputation effect; fifth, increase the penalty for false dividends of the service organization. Originality/value: Agricultural production trusteeship is in its initial stage in China. The interest relationships between stakeholders are not yet clear. The paper innovatively applies the evolutionary game method to the research field of the whole process trusteeship of agricultural production. According to conditions in China, based on ensuring the guaranteed income, the paper introduces the dividend income variable and establishes a tripartite game model of village committees, service organization and farmers. The paper provides suggestions for the orderly and healthy development of China's agricultural production trusteeship and provides experience for the operation of other modes of agricultural production trusteeship. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agricultural production trusteeship; Behavioral decision making; Evolutionary game; Social service organizations","Agricultural robots; Rural areas; Agricultural development; Agricultural modernizations; Agricultural productions; Asymptotically stable; Design/methodology/approach; Evolutionary game models; Evolutionary stability; Service organizations; Agriculture",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110963881

Some of the main problems in urban areas today are road congestions and consequently vehicle emissions. The aim of this paper is to propose a methodological approach for the estimation of vehicle emissions. The proposed methodology is based on two interrelated models. The first model is a microscopic simulation SUMO model which can be used to identify the most congested urban areas and roads with critical values of traffic parameters. The second model is the COPERT Street Level for estimating vehicle emissions. The proposed models were tested on the urban area of Rijeka. The results of the microscopic SUMO simulation model indicate six urban roads with the critical traffic flow parameters. On the basis of the six identified urban roads, an estimation of vehicle emissions was carried out for specific time periods: 2017, 2020, 2025, and 2030. According to the results of the second model, the urban road R20-21 was identified as the most polluted road in the urban district of Rijeka. The results indicate that over the period 2017–2030, CO emissions will be reduced on average by 57% on all observed urban roads, CO2 emissions by 20%, and PM emissions by 58%, while the largest reduction of 65% will be in NOx emissions. © 2021, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering.

Remote sensing and GIS tools can provide valuable information to deepen our understanding of the dynamics of these changes to better plan and build sustainable cities for the future. Using remote sensing data, socio-economic data, and field observations, we simulated spatiotemporal dynamics of land use and land cover changes in the city of Thimphu. Simulation results reveal that the landscape of Thimphu city has changed considerably during the study period and the change trend is predicted to continue into 2050. The study observed a significant increase (12.77%) in built-up area from 2002 (52.88%) to 2018 (65.5%), followed by a slight increase in the cover of bare ground. On the contrary, forest cover declined drastically (15.25%) followed by agriculture (1.01%). Rapid population growth triggered by rural urban migration coupled with hasty socio-economic development post democracy are the main drivers of these changes. These changes have fragmentated forest cover, increased soil/gully erosion, surface runoff, and storm induced floods of storm and sanitation drains, thereby impinging on the overall quality of life in the city. Under the business as usual scenario, prediction analysis for the year 2050 show that built up area will consume almost all of the city area (73.21%) with forest significantly reduced to patches making up only about 16% of the city. These findings beg for an urgent need to implement effective planning specially to protect the existing forest and water resources from further degradation. © 2020 The Author(s)","Bhutan; CA-Markov model; Detection; GIS; Prediction; Remote sensing; Thimphu",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108718570

This paper deploys a system dynamics model to illustrate how expanding the policy space of hydrology models to include socioeconomic feedbacks could address these challenges. In this regard, policies that can potentially mitigate general water scarcity in a region of the American Southwest in southern New Mexico are examined. We selected and tested policies with the potential to diminish water scarcity without compromising the system’s economic performance. These policies included supporting choices that reduce or limit the expansion of water-intensive crops, promoting workforce participation, encouraging investment in capital, and regulating land use change processes. The simulation results, after the proposed boundary expansion, unveiled intervention options not commonly exercised by water decision-makers, bolstering the argument that integrated approaches to water research that include socioeconomic feedbacks are crucial for the study of agricultural community resilience. © 2021 by the authors.

This motivated many authors to develop regional model simulations to estimate the vulnerability index of these agricultural systems to these climatic events, allowing them to provide a more reliable climatological data in the presence of hot and dry winds. In this review article, the main contributions provided by various researchers regarding the impact of climate change on Andean agriculture are detailed. According to the collected information, it is concluded that climate change in the Andes will cause countries such as Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana and Colombia, to increase their local temperature, potential for evapotranspiration and water scarcity, causing the loss of important crops such as rice. In contrast, countries such as Peru, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia and Uruguay will register lower temperatures that will affect their production and yield in crops such as quinoa, potatoes, tarwi, among others. © 2021 Corporacion Colombiana de Investigacion Agropecuaria Corpoica.

Their unique chemical structure comprises both a peptide and a lipid moiety. LPs are of major biotechnological interest owing to their emulsification, antitumor, immunomodulatory, and antimicrobial activities. To date, these versatile compounds have been applied across multiple industries, from pharmaceuticals through to food processing, cosmetics, agriculture, heavy metal, and hydrocarbon bioremediation. The variety of LP structures and the diversity of the environments from which LP-producing microorganisms have been isolated suggest important functions in their natural environment. However, our understanding of the ecological role of LPs is limited. In this review, the mode of action and the role of LPs in motility, antimicrobial activity, heavy metals removal and biofilm formation are addressed. We include discussion on the need to characterise LPs from a diversity of microorganisms, with a focus on taxa inhabiting ‘extreme’ environments. We introduce the use of computational target fishing and molecular dynamics simulations as powerful tools to investigate the process of interaction between LPs and cell membranes. Together, these advances will provide new understanding of the mechanism of action of novel LPs, providing greater insights into the roles of LPs in the natural environment. © 2021","Bioactivity; Biosurfactant; Lipopeptides; Microbial ecology; Molecular dynamics simulation","Bioactivity; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Cytology; Emulsification; Food processing; Heavy metals; Metabolites; Microorganisms; Anti-microbial activity; Antitumour activity; Biosurfactants; Dynamics simulation; Ecological roles; Immunomodulatory activities; Lipopeptides; Microbial ecology; Natural environments; Secondary metabolites; Molecular dynamics; biosurfactant; cosmetic; heavy metal; hydrocarbon; lipopeptide; agriculture; antimicrobial activity; biofilm; biological activity; bioremediation; cell membrane; ecology; microbial activity; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; priority journal; Review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102412079

During this process, consumers emphasize the importance of agri-food safety while farmers expect to increase their profits. Due to the complexity and dynamics of ASCs, the effective traceability and management for agri-food products face huge challenges. However, most of the existing solutions cannot well meet the requirements of traceability and management in ASCs. To address these challenges, we first design a blockchain-based ASC framework to provide product traceability, which guarantees decentralized security for the agri-food tracing data in ASCs. Next, a Deep Reinforcement learning based Supply Chain Management (DR-SCM) method is proposed to make effective decisions on the production and storage of agri-food products for profit optimization. The extensive simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed blockchain-based framework and the DR-SCM method under different ASC environments.

Urban agriculture is an approach to producing food inside cities where, globally, more than half the worlds population live. It has been shown to have a range of potential benefits, for instance in reducing waste and logistics costs. Increased uptake of urban farming can even relieve pressure on the natural environment by reducing the burden of production required from farmland by creating space for it to recover from accumulated damage as a result of the use of unsustainable farming practices historically. This article describes an approach for a new type of decision support system suitable for urban farming production. We discuss differences between the requirements and the users of decision support in urban agriculture, and those of ordinary agribusiness enterprises. A case study is performed using a novel technology for urban farming: a cyber-physical implementation of aquaponics is enhanced with adaptive capabilities using a digital twin system and machine learning. Aquaponics is a farming technique that utilizes a harmonious nutrient exchange cycle for growing plants and fish together, while conserving water, and possibly without the need for soil or even sunlight. Empirical results are provided that evaluate the use of data driven decision analytics and a digital twin model to plan production from the aquaponic system during a three month trial. Another set of results evaluate a proposed modelling framework for large scale urban agriculture ecosystems. This concept forms the basis of the suggested approach for an urban farming decision support system that coordinates the activities of many independent producers to target collective goals. © 2013 IEEE.","Decision support; digital twin; Internet of Things; metaheuristics; modelling; simulation; urban agriculture","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate change; Digital twin; Soil conservation; Accumulated damage; Adaptive capabilities; Data driven decision; Modelling framework; Natural environments; Nutrient exchange; Potential benefits; Urban agricultures; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101753832

In the present world, much research is going on in the field of renewable energy to replace conventional sources of energy. But it is not very easy to replace diesel engines with other sources due to the better power output and reliability. The emissions from CI engines are very harmful for human health and for the environment. The major emissions are smoke and NOx which need to be controlled in an effective manner. In this work, direct injection variable compression ratio CI engine was used in experimental investigations for determining the combustion characteristics for D–MXEE–NM blends at different compression ratios. By performance analysis and exhaust emission of engine at peak load, D–MXEE5–NM2.5 (diesel 92.5%, 2–methoxyethyl ether 5%, and nitromethane 2.5%) blend was identified as best blend among all tested fuel blends and pure diesel at normal compression ratio (17.5). Further, all considered fuels with different CR values at peak load were ranked by Entropy–VIKOR method. From the analysis, D–MXEE5–NM2.5 at CR 19.5 was found as best fuel blend (ranked first) among all fuel blends and different compression ratios considered with same experimental conditions. By comparison of best fuel blend D–MXEE5–NM2.5 (at advanced compression ratio 19.5) with diesel (at standard CR 17.5), emission decline (HC 66.66%, CO 70.00%, and smoke 16.09%) and performance improvement (decrement in BSFC 7.07% and increment in BTE 4.41%) were obtained significantly at peak load. However, negligible increment in NOx (3.58%) was observed. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","2–Methoxyethyl ether; Diesel; Emissions; Engine performance; MCDM; Nitromethane","additive; compression; engine; ether; experimental study; methane; oxygenation; performance assessment; research work; smoke; biofuel; carbon monoxide; ether; ether derivative; gasoline; methane; nitroalkane; nitrogen oxide; nitromethane; exhaust gas; human; reproducibility; Biofuels; Carbon Monoxide; Ether; Ethers; Gasoline; Humans; Methane; Nitrogen Oxides; Nitroparaffins; Reproducibility of Results; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095767373

The three steps in the modeling process are: (1) generation of the data sets with a detailed simulation model; (2) estimation of the system models from the data; (3) application of the obtained dynamic economic optimization model considering inorganic and organic fertilizer inputs. We demonstrate the approach with a case study: barley production in southern Finland on coarse and clay soils. Our results show that there is a synergy between climate change mitigation and water protection goals, and a trade-off between pollution mitigation and crop production goals. If a field is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and an insignificant source of water pollution, atmospheric externalities dominate the water externalities, even for a relatively low social cost of carbon (SCC). If a field is a significant source of water pollution, the SCC would have to be very high before atmospheric externalities dominate water externalities. In addition, an integrated nutrient management system appears better than a system in which only inorganic or organic fertilizer is used, although manure is not a solution to agriculture's GHG emissions problem. Moreover, GHG emissions and nitrogen and carbon leaching mitigation efforts should first be targeted at coarse soils rather than clay soils, because the marginal abatement costs are considerably lower for coarse soils. © 2020","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Crop production; Soil carbon; Soil nitrogen; Water pollution","climate change; crop production; fertilizer application; leaching; pollutant source; trade-off; water pollution; Finland; Hordeum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094601906

This paper analyses how impacts of climate change on the hydrological regimes and temperature patterns could affect the irrigated agricultural production in two case study areas, the Aspara and Isfara river basins. The methodology applied is based on analysis of temperature indicators and current cropping calendars in target locations combined with hydrological simulations by the process-based Soil and Water Integrated Model (SWIM) of the two river basins. The selected climate change projections comprise the moderate and high emissions scenarios - RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The results reveal that climate change will create unfavourable conditions for irrigated spring crops, due to decrease of discharge during the vegetation period. On the other hand, the projected shift of peak discharge to an earlier date offers benefits for irrigated winter cereals, providing more water for irrigation in spring. Results suggest that, there is an opportunity to adapt the irrigated agricultural production in the selected regions by fitting the cropping calendars to changing vegetation periods and to the timing of peak discharges. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","adaptation options; Central Asia; climate change adaptation; hydrological modelling; irrigated agriculture","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Risk assessment; Rivers; Vegetation; Watersheds; Agricultural productions; Climate change projections; Economic vulnerability; Hydrological simulations; Integrated modeling; Irrigated agriculture; Temperature indicators; Temperature patterns; Climate change; agricultural production; climate change; climate effect; hydrological regime; irrigation system; peak discharge; river discharge; seasonality; soil water; vegetation structure; vulnerability; Aral Sea; Central Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092222830

However, most studies only focus on the static water security status of the region, ignored the spatial flows of ecosystem services. Whereas by integrating the ecosystem services flows model into water security simulation, that we could provide scientific reference for achieving the local water resources sustainable development, and making effective ecological compensation policy. In our study, ecosystem service flows model was integrated into water security assessment to simulate the spatial patterns of water security in Weihe River Basin (WRB) from 2005 to 2015. The results show that (1) the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources in WRB was prominent, due to the upstream water resources supply, the areas which achieve water security accounted for 10.89% each year. Furthermore, the insufficient and unsupplied areas were increased, which was adverse to the sustainable development of the river basin. (2) The water security index (WSI) in WRB was the lowest in 2010, and the highest in 2005. The change of regional WSI was influenced by the nature environment and human beings, and the main factors were agricultural water consumption and population. (3) The spatial heterogeneity of agricultural water consumption was diverse in the whole river basin, the agricultural water-use efficiency in Weinan City was lower, while the per residential domestic water in Xi'an and Xianyang city was much higher. Therefore local government should advocate develop water-saving agriculture and control urban water quotas, moreover, by adjusting water price cost and raise raising residents' human awareness of water-saving so as to improve the water security in the river basin.

Different scenarios were simulated, combining agricultural systems, patterns of distribution of settlements, population densities and rainfall variability. The models showed that scenarios based on slash-and-burn agriculture only exhibit a collapse, with population densities much lower than those widely accepted by archaeologists.

We investigate the potential of structured boundary objects to facilitate exposing and reconciling these trade-offs within the context of multi-stakeholder social learning processes with pastoral and mixed crop-livestock communities in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Tanzania. Building on boundary objects as items flexible enough to be understood by all without having one common definition, structured boundary objects visualize actors’ input in a comparable format to facilitate knowledge sharing. Stakeholders in each country used a simulation tool and board game to explore the implications of changing livestock stocking and management practices for the environment and for actors’ future socio-economic priorities. Using structured boundary objects elicited trade-offs between household food and animal feed, and between livestock for income, labour, and/ or cultural functions, reflecting the context-specific and subjective evaluations actors make when attempting to plan livelihood changes.

Against this backdrop, this study aims to analyse the differential impact of monetary policy on aggregate demand, aggregate supply and their components along with the general price level in India. Design/methodology/approach: The study develops a structural macroeconometric model, which is primarily aggregate and eclectic in nature. The generalized method of movements is used for estimation of behavioural equations, while a Gauss–Seidel algorithm is used for model simulation purposes. Findings: The paper presents the results of two policy simulations from the estimated model that highlight the differential impact of monetary policy. The first one, hike in the policy rate by 5% and second is a reduction in bank credit to the commercial sector by 10%. The results from the first policy simulation experiment reveal that interest hike has a significant negative impact on aggregate demand, aggregate supply and general price level. However, the maximum impact is borne by investment demand and imports followed by private consumption. While as among the components of aggregate supply maximum impact is born by infrastructure output followed by the manufacturing and services sector with the agriculture sector found to be insensitive in nature. The results from the second policy simulation experiment revealed that pure monetary shocks have a significant negative impact on aggregate demand, aggregate supply and general price level. However, the maximum impact is born by private consumption and imports followed by investment demand. While as among components of aggregate supply maximum impact is borne by infrastructure followed by the manufacturing and services sector with the agriculture sector found to be insensitive in nature. From both policy simulation experiments, the study highlighted the relative importance of the income absorption approach as opposed to the expenditure switching effect. Practical implications: The results obtained in this study provides a strong framework for design the monetary policy framework. The results are in a view of the differential impact of monetary policy action among the components of both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. This reflection of differential impact has immense significance for the macroeconomic stabilization as the central bank will have to weigh the varying repercussion of its actions on different sectors. For instance, the decline in output after monetary tightening might be conceived as mild from an overall perspective, but it can be appreciable for some sectors. This differential influence will have an implication for policy design to care for distributional aspects, which otherwise could be neglected/disregarded. Similarly, the output decline may be as a result of either consumption postponement or a temporary slowdown in investment. However, the one emanating due to investment decline will have lasting growth implications compared to a decline in consumer demand. In addition, the relative strength of expenditure changing or expenditure switching policies of trade balance stabilization may have varying consequences in the aftermath of monetary policy shock. Accordingly information on the relative sensitiveness/insensitiveness of different sectors/ components of aggregate demand towards monetary policy actions furnish valuable insights to monetary authorities in framing appropriate policy. Originality/value: The work carried out in the present paper is motivated by the fact that although a number of studies have examined the monetary transmission mechanism in India, a very few studies examining the differential impact of monetary policy action.

Since many societal impacts from a lack of water happen under drought conditions, it is important to understand how droughts may develop with climate change. This study shows how hydrological droughts will change across Europe with increasing global warming levels (GWLs of 1.5, 2, and 3K above preindustrial temperature). We employed a low-flow analysis based on river discharge simulations of the LISFLOOD (De Roo et al., 2000) spatially distributed physically based hydrological and water use model, which was forced with a large ensemble of regional climate model projections under high emissions (RCP8.5) and moderate mitigation (RCP4.5) Representative Concentration Pathways. Different traits of drought, including severity, duration, and frequency, were investigated using the threshold level method. The projected changes in these traits identify four main sub-regions in Europe that are characterized by somehow homogeneous and distinct behaviours with a clear south-west north-east contrast. The Mediterranean and Boreal sub-regions (defined in Sect. 3.1.1) of Europe show strong but opposite changes at all three GWLs, with the former area mostly characterized by stronger droughts (with larger differences at 3 K), while the latter is expected to experience a reduction in all drought traits. In the Atlantic and Continental sub-regions, the changes are expected to be less marked and characterized by a larger uncertainty, especially at the 1.5 and 2K GWLs. Combining the projections in drought hazard with population and agricultural information shows that with 3K global warming an additional 11 million people and 4.5106 ha of agricultural land are projected to be exposed to droughts every year, on average, with the most affected areas located in the Mediterranean and Atlantic regions of Europe. © 2020 Royal Society of Chemistry.

The present study deals with the geochemistry of groundwater at various depths to investigate the hydrogeochemical processes controlling the water quality of Meghna floodplain, the sources and mechanisms of arsenic (As) liberation, and the estimation of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health risks (using probabilistic and deterministic approaches) to the adults and children of the Comilla district, central-east Bangladesh. The groundwaters were generally of Ca–Mg–HCO3 type, and water-sediment interaction was the dominant factor in evolving the chemical signatures. The dissolution of carbonates, weathering of silicates, and cation exchange processes governed the major ion chemistry. Dissolved As concentration ranged from 0.002 to 0.36 mg/L and Monte Carlo simulation-based probabilistic estimation of cancer risk suggested that; (1) ~ 83% of the waters exceeded the higher end of the acceptable limit of 1 × 10−4; (2) the probability of additional cases of cancer in every 10,000 adults and children were on average ~9 and ~5, respectively; (3) adults were more susceptible than children; and (4) ingestion was the main pathway of As poisoning and the contribution of dermal contact was negligible (&lt;1%). According to sensitivity analysis, the duration of exposure to As and its concentration in groundwater posed the greatest impact on cancer risk assessment. However, hydrogeochemical investigations on the sources and mobilization mechanisms of As suggested that the reductive dissolution of Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides was the principal process of As release in groundwater. The oxidation of pyrite and competitive exchange of fertilizer-derived phosphate for the sorbed As were not postulated as the plausible explanation for As liberation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Arsenic contamination; Geochemical weathering; Groundwater geochemistry; Human health risk; Monte Carlo simulation","arsenic; calcium; chloride; fluoride; ground water; iron; magnesium; manganese; nitrate; phosphate; phosphate fertilizer; potassium; pyrite; rain; silicate; silicon; sodium; sulfate; arsenic; ground water; phosphate; sulfide; arsenic; chemical weathering; floodplain; groundwater pollution; health risk; hydrogeochemistry; Monte Carlo analysis; probability; risk assessment; water quality; adult; arsenic poisoning; Article; Bangladesh; cancer risk; cation exchange; child; concentration (parameter); controlled study; electric conductivity; environmental exposure; floodplain; fluid intake; geochemistry; health hazard; health impact assessment; human; hydrodynamics; irrigation (agriculture); leaching; limit of detection; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; Monte Carlo method; pH; physical chemistry; precipitation; probability; risk assessment; seasonal variation; sediment; soil moisture; thermodynamics; thermostability; urban area; water contamination; water quality; water sampling; water supply; weathering; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; risk assessment; water pollutant; Bangladesh; Chittagong [Bangladesh]; Comilla; Adult; Arsenic; Bangladesh; Child; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Humans; Iron; Phosphates; Risk Assessment; Sulfides; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091597852

This study aims to assess smallholder farmers' adaptive capacity to climate change by using a mixed weighting scheme that reflect farmers’ perceived importance of adaptive capacity components to inform policy makers. To achieve that objective, the sustainable livelihood framework was adopted and indicator approach was used for the assessment. The mixed weighting scheme were defined by using both equal weights and experts judgement methods during the assessment process. The mixed weighting scheme index is compared to the case where equal weights are applied in the assessment process and an uncertainty analysis was performed on relative standard deviation through a Monte Carlo simulation. Primary Data were collected from 450 farmers in two communities in northern Benin with a structured questionnaire and through focus groups discussion. The results show that smallholder farmers in both communities do not have the same perceived importance of adaptive capacity components. The index scores show that farmers have in majority low adaptive capacity. When weighted product aggregation method is used, there is more uncertainty related to the index computed with the mixed weighting scheme, but it leads to the same characterisation when compared with the index computed with the equal weights. It is recommended that mixed weighting scheme should be preferred for the assessment of adaptive capacity and weighted product aggregation method should be used. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Smallholder farmers; Weighting scheme","adaptive management; assessment method; climate change; policy making; questionnaire survey; sustainability; trade-off; uncertainty analysis; agricultural worker; article; Benin; climate change; decision making; human; human experiment; Monte Carlo method; sensitivity analysis; structured questionnaire; uncertainty; agriculture; questionnaire; Benin; Agriculture; Benin; Climate Change; Farmers; Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090157329

Deforestation is counteracted by reforestation processes, which is caused by the natural regeneration of forests or by the establishment of plantations. The present research is focused on generating a simulation model to predict the deforestation and reforestation for 2030 and 2050 using geospatial analysis techniques and multicriteria evaluation. The case study is the North Pacific Basin, which is one of the areas with the greatest loss of forest cover in Mexico. The results of the spatial analysis of forest dynamics determined that the forest area in 2030 would be 98,713.52 km2, while in 2050 would be 101,239.8 km2. The mean annual deforestation and reforestation expected in the study area is 115 and 193.84 km2, for the 2014–2030 period, while mean annual deforestation and reforestation values of 95 and 221.31 km2 are expected for the 2030–2050 period. Therefore, considering the forest cover predicted by the deforestation and reforestation model, a carbon capture of 16,209.67 ton/C was estimated for the 2014–2030 period and 587,596.01 ton/C for the 2030–2050. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the performance of water markets varies greatly across different countries, and in only very few countries do they work well. In this study, a two-sector water rights trading model is developed and applied to a case study in China. The results suggest that arable land per farmer is a key factor that affects the performance of water markets in China. This is positively correlated with traded water volume, with the market’s economic efficiency, and with the social welfare the market brings. Although the model simulation ignores other factors, this problem can be solved by selecting a suitable research area. These findings suggest that water markets may be less likely to be effective in countries with small arable land per farmer. © 2020 by the authors.

We describe a new spatial modeling platform that integrates mapping of phenology and climatic suitability in real-time to provide timely and comprehensive guidance for stakeholders needing to know both where and when invasive insect species could potentially invade the conterminous United States. The Degree-Days, Risk, and Phenological event mapping (DDRP) platform serves as an open-source and relatively easy-to-parameterize decision support tool to help detect new invasive threats, schedule monitoring and management actions, optimize biological control, and predict potential impacts on agricultural production. DDRP uses a process-based modeling approach in which degree-days and temperature stress are calculated daily and accumulate over time to model phenology and climatic suitability, respectively. Outputs include predictions of the number of completed generations, life stages present, dates of phenological events, and climatically suitable areas based on two levels of climate stress. Species parameter values can be derived from laboratory and field studies or estimated through an additional modeling step. DDRP is written entirely in R, making it flexible and extensible, and capitalizes on multiple R packages to generate gridded and graphical outputs. We illustrate the DDRP modeling platform and the process of model parameterization using two invasive insect species as example threats to United States agriculture: the light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana, and the small tomato borer, Neoleucinodes elegantalis. We then discuss example applications of DDRP as a decision support tool, review its potential limitations and sources of model error, and outline some ideas for future improvements to the platform.

Funds are meant to be allocated not to any types of beneficial investments with or without climate change but to projects regarded as effective for climate change adaptation based on some metrics. But attempts at such project-specific evaluation of adaptation effects are few, in part because such assessments require an integration of various types of simulation analyses. Against this background, we conduct a case study of a Kenyan irrigation development project using a combination of downscaled climate data, runoff simulations, yield forecasting, and local socioeconomic projections to examine the effects of interventions specifically attributable to climate change adaptation, i.e., how much irrigation development can reduce the negative effects of climate change in the future. The results show that despite the uncertainties in precipitation trends, increased temperatures due to climate change have a general tendency to reduce rice yields, and that irrigation development will mitigate income impacts from the yield loss–for example, for the median scenario, the household income loss of 6% in 2050 due to climate change without irrigation development is flipped to become positive with the project. This means that the irrigation development project will likely be effective as a means for climate change adaptation. © 2020 Narita et al.

AGNR managers purport using a systems-oriented mental model while many observed management and policy strategies remain linear or symptom-driven. To improve AGNR professionals’ systems thinking abilities, two programs, the King Ranch® Institute for Ranch Management at Texas A&M University-Kingsville (KRIRM) and the Honors College at South Dakota State University (SDSUHC), implemented the famous Production Distribution Simulation Game (a.k.a. the Beer Game) into their programs beginning in 2003 and 2011. A Beer Game database consisting of 10 years of trials or over 270 individual players was compared to seminal work in the literature as well as to one another. We found that AGNR managers and students performed worse than players in a seminal Beer Game study. More interestingly, we found that younger players adapted more readily to inventory surpluses by reducing the order rates and effective inventories significantly when compared to older players (p < 0.10 for retailer and distributors, and p < 0.05 for wholesales and factories). We substantiated our results to those in more recent studies of age-related decision-making and in the context of common learning disabilities.

In conventional livestock husbandry systems with insulated buildings, mechanical ventilation systems and high stocking density pigs and poultry can be more affected by climate change than in free range husbandry systems. To reduce heat stress in livestock buildings, adaptation measures are used. This article assesses a wide variety of adaptation measures including energy-saving air treatment systems, which cool the inlet air (e.g. cooling pads, earth-air-heat exchanger), the use of certain building elements (e.g., insulation), optimising building characteristics (e.g., spatial orientation), modification of the indoor climate at the animal level (e.g., fogging, cooling the drinking water, increasing air velocity), and adaptation of livestock management (e.g., reduction of stocking density). The efficacy of some of these measures was quantified using simulation models and then used as a benchmark for assessing the efficacy of other measures. The efficacy of the various adaptation measures varies widely: air treatment devices which are cooling the inlet air showed the highest performance, while measures aimed at reducing the heat release of the animals (e.g., lower animal density, higher ventilation rate) performed poorest. In confined livestock systems, the reduction of heat stress by implementing adaptation measures will reduce economical losses. The selection of appropriate adaptation measures, in addition to improving animal welfare, can also be seen as a contribution to strengthen the economic resilience of farmers. © 2020 The Author(s)","climate change; farm animal; pig; poultry; thermal stress; ventilation system","Air; Buildings; Cooling systems; Earth (planet); Energy conservation; Global warming; Mammals; Potable water; Thermal processing (foods); Thermal stress; Ventilation; Building characteristics; Earth-air heat exchangers; Livestock buildings; Livestock systems; Mechanical ventilation system; Spatial orientations; Temperate climate; Ventilation rate; Agriculture",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092259818

It has greatly increased the vegetation cover on the Loess Plateau but occupied the space of agricultural development (AD) over the years. Research on the impact of policy implementation on ecosystem services (ESs) and their trade-offs can support scenario analyses that provide realistic guidance for decision makers to formulate future regional ecological restoration planning. Our focus is Ningwu County and Jingle County on the Loess Plateau, a typical ecologically fragile and impoverished area where expansion of vegetation cover has driven extensive loss of farmland and its benefits to farmers. In this study, soil conservation (SC), water yield (WY), habitat quality (HQ), and food supply (FS) were selected to assess the change of ESs and their trade-offs in different scenarios that represent ecological restoration and land reclamation policies. The results revealed that overall ESs had the largest increase but there were more trade-offs among ESs under the GFGP scenario. For a single ESs, SC and HQ were increased while FS and WY were decreased under the GFGP scenario. From the view of trade-offs, the GFGP scenario exhibited more trade-offs than the AD scenario. Furthermore, compared to the GFGP scenario, the numbers of sub-watersheds with trade-offs of ESs decreased under the AD scenario. With more concern about the contradiction between implementing GFGP and protecting farmland, we confirm that it is extremely unwise to incessantly implement GFGP to improve overall ESs without considering the trade-offs among ESs. Given the certain sub-watersheds mainly developing agriculture, the AD scenario appears to best reduce trade-offs among ESs and ensure the improvement of ESs. Therefore, it is of great significance to realize the win-win situation of regional ecological and resource demand to find the most suitable development direction in the future. © 2020","Agricultural development area; Ecosystem services; Grain for Green; Land use change; Loess Plateau","agricultural development; computer simulation; decision making; ecosystem service; environmental degradation; land use change; policy implementation; restoration ecology; trade-off; vegetation cover; China; Loess Plateau; Ningwu; Shanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091555106

The analysis is based on social accounting matrix (SAM) of Oromia region. This Oromia SAM is employed as a framework to estimate the effects of policy shocks on rural households’ social welfare. This SAM provides base year data needed for policy simulation in CGE model of Oromia region. This study develops two simulations based on economic assumptions and tests their effects on agricultural production, and social welfare. The first set of experiment focuses on the irrigation policies that change the factor intensities in the production of agricultural commodities, and the second one focuses on the precision agriculture that raises agricultural productivity in the use of technologies. The analysis identifies that irrigation scaling up has a positive effect on agricultural production, and social welfare. The application of precision agriculture generates a significant and positive effect on agricultural productivity and production, and rural households’ income and consumption. This finding suggests that price support policy should be implemented simultaneously with suggested policies. © 2020, The Author(s).","Agricultural policies; Agricultural production; Employment; Income and consumption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089434689

The aim of this work is to improve our understanding of heat waves over the Mediterranean basin during the 21st century from an ensemble of Regional Climate Models (RCMs). Focus has been placed on sensitivities to forcing global models, emissions scenarios and the RCM resolution, being the first work based on Euro-CORDEX simulations to fully analyze future heat waves in the Mediterranean. Heat wave features are studied with Warm Spell Duration Index (WSDI, duration) and Heat Wave Magnitude Index daily (HWMId, intensity). Results indicate a large increase by the end of the century in both intensity and length of heat waves from all emissions scenarios, global models, and regional models at any resolution. Exceptional heat waves observed early on the century could then become normal by the end of this period. Forcing global models and emissions scenarios play a major role.

Wexford, Ireland","North Atlantic European grassland systems have a low nutrient use efficiency and high rainfall. This grassland is typically amended with unprocessed slurry, which counteracts soil organic matter depletion and provides essential plant micronutrients but can be mobilised during rainfall events thereby contributing to pathogen, nutrient and metal incidental losses. Co-digesting slurry with waste from food processing mitigates agriculture-associated environmental impacts but may alter microbial, nutrient and metal profiles and their transmission to watercourses, and/or soil persistence, grass yield and uptake. The impact of EU and alternative pasteurisation regimes on transmission potential of these various pollutants is not clearly understood, particularly in pasture-based agricultural systems. This study utilized simulated rainfall (Amsterdam drip-type) at a high intensity indicative of a worst-case scenario of ~11 mm hr−1 applied to plots 1, 2, 15 and 30 days after grassland application of slurry, unpasteurised digestate, pasteurised digestate (two conditions) and untreated controls. Runoff and soil samples were collected and analysed for a suite of potential pollutants including bacteria, nutrients and metals following rainfall simulation. Grass samples were collected for three months following application to assess yield as well as nutrient and metal uptake. For each environmental parameter tested: microbial, nutrient and metal runoff losses; accumulation in soil and uptake in grass, digestate from anaerobic co-digestion of slurry with food processing waste resulted in lower pollution potential than traditional landspreading of slurry without treatment. Reduced microbial runoff from digestate was the most prominent advantage of digestate application. Pasteurisation of the digestate further augmented those environmental benefits, without impacting grass output. Anaerobic co-digestion of slurry is therefore a multi-beneficial circular approach to reducing impacts of livestock production on the environment. © 2020 The Authors","Agriculture; Anaerobic digestate; Pasteurisation; Pollution abatement; Slurry","Agricultural robots; Anaerobic digestion; Food microbiology; Forestry; Metals; Pasteurization; Processed foods; Rain; Runoff; Soil pollution; Soil surveys; Soils; Transmissions; Anaerobic co-digestion; Environmental benefits; Environmental parameter; Food processing wastes; Livestock production; Nutrient-use efficiencies; Plant micro-nutrients; Transmission potential; Nutrients; rain; trace element; fertilizer; metal; cattle; European Union; grassland; livestock farming; microbial community; mitigation; pathogen; rainfall; slurry; agricultural slurry; Article; concentration (parameter); contamination; controlled study; Enterococcus; environmental impact; Escherichia coli; food processing waste; grass; grassland; infectious agent; land spreading; nonhuman; nutrient; nutrient uptake; organic matter production; pasteurization; pathogen load; priority journal; runoff; soil analysis; agriculture; animal; bovine; manure; Poaceae; soil; Bos; Agriculture; Animals; Cattle; Fertilizers; Manure; Metals; Nutrients; Poaceae; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088754512

During wet years, high precipitation disproportionately contributes to P losses. We combine simulations of a gridded crop model and outputs from a number of hydrological and climate models to assess global impacts of changes in precipitation regimes on P losses during the 21st century. Under the baseline climate during 1991-2010, median P losses are 2.7 ± 0.5 kg P ha-1 year-1 over global croplands of four major crops, while during wet years, P losses are 3.6 ± 0.7 kg P ha-1 year-1. By the end of this century, P losses in wet years would reach 4.2 ± 1.0 (RCP2.6) and 4.7 ± 1.3 (RCP8.5) kg P ha-1 year-1 due to increases in high annual precipitation alone. The increases in P losses are the highest (up to 200%) in the arid regions of Middle East, Central Asia, and northern Africa. Consequently, in three quarters of the world's river basins, representing about 40% of total global runoff and home up to 7 billion people, P dilution capacity of freshwater could be exceeded due to P losses from croplands by the end of this century. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Crops; Phosphorus; Annual precipitation; Central Asia; Environmental problems; Global impacts; Inland waters; Phosphorus loss; Precipitation regimes; River basins; Climate models; fresh water; phosphorus; agricultural land; future prospect; global change; phosphorus; precipitation (climatology); scenario analysis; Article; catchment area (hydrology); controlled study; cropland; futurology; hydrological model; precipitation; time series analysis; water pollution; Africa; agriculture; crop; human; river; Africa, Northern; Agriculture; Crops, Agricultural; Humans; Phosphorus; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096347700

Mixed-wastewater pollution is a common phenomenon in the developing countries as the technologies to treat the individual waste streams at source are lacking due to high operational and maintenance costs. Therefore, the need to explore the potential of the suspended growth process which is a well-established process technology for biological wastewater treatment is the focus of this paper. Different wastewater constituents: representing domestic, pharmaceutical, textile, petroleum, and agricultural runoff were synthesized as a representative of mixed-wastewater and treated in two semi-continuous bioreactors (R1 & R2) operated at constant operating conditions, namely MLSS (mg/L): 4640-R1, 4440-R2, SRT: 21-d, HRT: 48–72 h, and uncontrolled pH.

In this application, sensors gather different types of data (i.e., humidity, carbon dioxide level, and temperature) in real-time scenarios. Thus, data gathering, transmission, and rapid response to new circumstances require a secured data mechanism to avoid malicious adversaries. Therefore, this paper focuses on data security from the data origin source to the end-user, and proposes a general data security model that is independent of the network topology and structure, and can be widely used in the agriculture monitoring application. The developed model considers practical aspects, the architecture of the sensor node, as well as the necessity to save energy while ensuring data security, and optimize the model through the application of organizational and technical measures. The model evaluation is conducted through simulation in terms of energy consumption. The result shows that the proposed model ensures good data security at the cost of a slight increase in energy consumption at receiver and sender nodes, and energy consumption per bit, up to 2%, 7%, and 1.3%, respectively, due to overhead added for authentication in the network. © 2020 by the authors.

These measures failed to improve attitudes to pig husbandry. The present study uses a more comprehensive approach by evaluating animal welfare measures in terms of their effect on animal welfare, farm income and public attitudes. Four measures were defined for each of the following societal aspects of sow husbandry: piglet mortality; tail biting and the indoor housing of gestating sows. A simulation model was developed to estimate the effects of the measures and Data Envelopment Analysis used to compare measures in terms of their effects on animal welfare, farm income and public attitudes. Only piglet mortality measures were found to have a positive effect on farm income but they showed a relatively low effect on animal welfare and public attitudes. The most efficient measure was that which included straw provision, daylight and increased group sizes for gestating sows.

Adaptation strategies were developed that are locally relevant by identifying a set of technologies that help to offset potential impacts of climate change on maize yields. Impacts and adaptation options were evaluated using projections by 20 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Two widely used crop simulation models, Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) was used to simulate the potential impacts of climate change on maize. Results showed that 20 CMIP5 models are consistent in their projections of increased surface temperatures with different magnitude. Projections by HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC-ESM tend to be higher than the rest of 17 CMIP5 climate models under both emission scenarios. The projected increase in minimum temperature (Tmin) which ranged between 2.7 and 5.8°C is higher than the increase in maximum temperature (Tmax) that varied between 2.2 and 4.8°C by end century under RCP 8.5. Future projections in rainfall are less certain with high variability projections by GFDL-ESM2G, MIROC5, and NorESM1-M suggest 8 to 25% decline in rainfall, while CanESM2, IPSL-CM5A-MR and BNU-ESM suggested more than 85% increase in rainfall under RCP 8.5 by end of 21st century. Impacts of current and future climatic conditions on maize yields varied depending on the AEZs, soil type, crop management and climate change scenario. Impacts are largely negative in the low potential AEZs such as Lower Midlands (LM4 and LM5) compared with the high potential AEZs Upper Midlands (UM2 and UM3). However, impacts of climate change are largely positive across all AEZs and management conditions when CO2 fertilization is included. Using the differential impacts of climate change, a strategy to adapt maize cultivation to climate change in all the five AEZs was identified by consolidating those practices that contributed to increased yields under climate change. We consider this approach as more appropriate to identify operational adaptation strategies using readily available technologies that contribute positively under both current and future climatic conditions. This approach when adopted in strategic manner will also contribute to further strengthen the development of adaptation strategies at national and local levels. The methods and tools validated and applied in this assessment allowed estimating possible impacts of climate change and adaptation strategies which can provide valuable insights and guidance for adaptation planning. © 2020 Gummadi et al.

Water, Energy and Food are the key variables of the “Nexus Thinking” which face the sustainability challenge with a multi-sectoral approach. The aim of the paper is to show the methodological path toward the implementation of an integrated modeling platform based on the Nexus approach and consolidated energy system analysis methods to represent the agri-food system in a circular economy perspective (from the use of water, energy, biomass, and land to food production). The final aim is to support decision-making connected to climate change mitigation.

As an approach to identify effective future land-use strategies, this study applied spatially explicit modeling that addresses the spatial connectivity between the provision of ecosystem services and agricultural land-use systems. Considering that the status of ecosystem services varies with the perception of stakeholders, local knowledge, and characteristics of a case study area, two adjoining districts in northern Ghana were integrated into an assessment process of land-use strategies. Based on agricultural land-management options that were identified together with the local stakeholders, 75 future land-use strategies as combinations of multiple agricultural practices were elaborated. Potential impacts of the developed land-use strategies on ecosystem services and land-use patterns were assessed in a modeling platform that combines Geographic Information System (GIS) and Cellular Automaton (CA) modules. Modeled results were used to identify best land-use strategies that could deliver multiple ecosystem services most effectively. Then, local perception was applied to determine the feasibility of the best land-use strategies in practice. The results presented the different extent of trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services delivered by future land-use strategies and their different feasibility depending on the district. Apart from the fact that findings were context-specific and scale-dependent, this study revealed that the integration of different local characteristics and local perceptions to spatially explicit ecosystem service assessment is beneficial for determining locally tailored recommendations for future agricultural land-use planning. © 2020 by the authors.

A series of annual air quality model simulations corresponding to different emission reduction scenarios has been performed with a three-dimensional chemical transport modelling chain running at 3 km resolution. The emission reduction scenarios were used to develop bottom-up (locally produced) source-receptor relationships to perform a local source allocation analysis of the main atmospheric pollutants in a few polluted cities within the domain of interest. Results were compared with default top-down (EU-wide) source-receptor relationships, at roughly 7 km resolution. The results show the benefit of using the two sources of information in an integrated way. The analysis of the impacts of local emission reductions on concentrations and of the source allocation results reveals that nitrogen oxides concentrations are mostly affected by local emission sources, especially road transport and harbour related activities while the contribution of non-local sources is important for particulate matter (especially from industry and agriculture sources). For PM, larger scale modelling approaches (top-down) are necessary. Ideally, both a bottom-up approach for the characterisation of the local emission sources and a top-down larger scale approach to capture the impact of non-local sources would be necessary to perform an accurate source allocation, and provide support to the design of local air quality plans. © 2020 The Authors","Air quality models; CHIMERE; Inventory emissions; SHERPA methodology; Source allocation","Agricultural robots; Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Air quality modeling; Atmospheric pollutants; Bottom up approach; Modelling techniques; Nitrogen oxides concentration; Particulate Matter; Source-receptor relationships; Three dimensional chemicals; Atmospheric movements; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; bottom-up approach; coastal zone; design; emission control; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; source apportionment; top-down approach; agriculture; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; controlled study; industry; Italy; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; pollution transport; priority journal; resource allocation; simulation; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090038106

Recent studies have suggested that a major, possibly dominant contributor to this air quality decline is that northwest (NW) Indian rice residue burning has shifted later into the post-monsoon season, as an unintended consequence of a 2009 groundwater preservation policy that delayed the sowing of irrigated rice paddy. Here we combine air quality modelling of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) over IGP cities, with meteorology, fire and smoke emissions data to directly test this hypothesis. Our analysis of satellite-derived agricultural fires shows that an approximate 10 d shift in the timing of NW India post-monsoon residue burning occurred since the introduction of the 2009 groundwater preservation policy. For the air quality crisis of 2016, we found that NW Indian CRB timing shifts made a small contribution to worsening air quality (3% over Delhi) during the post-monsoon season. However, if the same agricultural fires were further delayed, air quality in the CRB source region (i.e. Ludhiana) and for Delhi could have deteriorated by 30% and 4.4%, respectively. Simulations for other years highlight strong inter-annual variabilities in the impact of these timing shifts, with the magnitude and even direction of PM2.5 concentration changes strongly dependent on specific meteorological conditions. Overall we find post-monsoon IGP air quality to be far more sensitive to meteorology and the amount of residue burned in the fields of NW India than to the timing shifts in residue burning. Our study calls for immediate actions to provide farmers affordable and sustainable alternatives to residue burning to hasten its effective prohibition, which is paramount to reducing the intensity of post-monsoon IGP air pollution episodes. © 2020 The Author(s).","Agriculture; Air quality; Crop residue burning; Earth observation; Groundwater; Indo-Gangetic Plain; Policy","Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Air quality; Crops; Groundwater; Meteorology; Smoke; Timing circuits; Air pollution episodes; Air quality modelling; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Indo-Gangetic Plains; Interannual variability; Meteorological condition; Preservation policies; Unintended consequences; Atmospheric thermodynamics; air quality; atmospheric pollution; crop residue; hypothesis testing; paddy field; particulate matter; rice; smoke; sowing; Delhi; Gangetic Plain; India; Ludhiana; Punjab [India]; Oryza sativa (indica cultivar-group)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090017341

The simulation model developed using the Discrete Event Specification System (DEVS) formalism, captures the equipment characteristics and tracks the evolution of its movement across the field via state transition tables. The model is data driven and spatially and temporally detailed, which are key features to accurately estimate field efficiency.

Because farmers do not consider the contribution of their individual consumption of antibiotics to AMR, regulations are necessary to ensure optimal use. However, previously suggested regulatory instruments are either inefficient or nearly impossible to implement, mainly because they fail to address the information asymmetry that exists between farmers and regulators. In this article, we customize and suggest an efficient and incentive-compatible regulatory instrument for antibiotic use based on the Montero auction mechanism (2008). We analytically and empirically demonstrate that the proposed auction mechanism is welfare improving as compared to current regulations. For the empirical analysis, we calibrate a simulation model for the Danish livestock sector based on farm accounts data for different types of livestock farms and combine it with calibrated demand functions for antibiotic allowances and a calibrated damage function. Based on the simulation results and the implementation of systems such as the Danish VETSTAT (a detailed accounting of farmers' antibiotic use), we anticipate that the proposed mechanism can be effectively used in the future. © 2020 Agricultural and Applied Economics Association","antibiotic efficacy; Antibiotics; antimicrobial resistance; asymmetric information; auctions; common pool resource; externality; mechanism design","agricultural development; antibiotic resistance; antibiotics; antimicrobial activity; consumption behavior; farmers knowledge; livestock farming; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079596628

Socioeconomic development of rural parts of the USA was enabled partly through the eradication by 1943 of cattle fever ticks (CFT, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus and R. (B.) microplus). The southern cattle fever ticks (SCFT, R. (B.) microplus) remain a real and present threat to the USA animal agriculture because they are established in Mexico. Livestock-wildlife interactions in the Permanent Quarantine Zone (PQZ) established by the century-old Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Programme (CFTEP) in south Texas endanger its operations. Methods: We describe a spatially-explicit, individual-based model that simulates interactions between cattle, white-tailed deer (WTD, Odocoileus virginianus), and nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) to assess the risk for SCFT infestations across the pathogenic landscape in the PQZ and beyond. We also investigate the potential role of nilgai in sustaining SCFT populations by simulating various hypothetical infestation and eradication scenarios. Results: All infestation scenarios resulted in a phase transition from a relatively small proportion of the ranch infested to almost the entire ranch infested coinciding with the typical period of autumn increases in off-host tick larvae. Results of eradication scenarios suggest that elimination of all on-host ticks on cattle, WTD, or nilgai would have virtually no effect on the proportion of the ranch infested or on the proportions of different tick habitat types infested; the entire ranch would remain infested. If all on-host ticks were eliminated on cattle and WTD, WTD and nilgai, or cattle and nilgai, the proportions of the ranch infested occasionally would drop to 0.6, 0.6 and 0.2, respectively. Differences in proportions of the ranch infested from year to year were due to primarily to differences in winter weather conditions, whereas infestation differences among tick habitat types were due primarily to habitat use preferences of hosts. Conclusions: Infestations in nilgai augment SCFT refugia enabled by WTD and promote pest persistence across the landscape and cattle parasitism. Our study documented the utility of enhanced biosurveillance using simulation tools to mitigate risk and enhance operations of area-wide tick management programmes like the CFTEP through integrated tactics for SCFT suppression.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020 The Author(s).","Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program; Host-parasite interaction; Individual-based model; Integrated tick management research; Rhipicephalus microplus; Spatially-explicit model; Stochastic","antelope; Article; biosurveillance; Boselaphus tragocamelus; bovine; environmental temperature; habitat use; high temperature; invasive pest; larva; livestock; nonhuman; parasite clearance; phase transition; population density; Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus; risk assessment; seasonal variation; simulation; survival; tick infestation; white tailed deer; wildlife; animal; biosurveillance; cattle disease; classification; deer; genetics; introduced species; livestock; Mexico; parasitology; physiology; Rhipicephalus; season; spatiotemporal analysis; Texas; veterinary medicine; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Biosurveillance; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Deer; Introduced Species; Livestock; Mexico; Rhipicephalus; Seasons; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Texas; Tick Infestations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091548332

However, quantifying the impact of land management practices on soil GHG fluxes including CO2 and N2O is difficult due temporal and spatial variability of localized weather conditions and subfield soil properties. A process-based biogeochemistry modeling framework coupled with public soils, weather, and yield data layers was used to estimate regionally specific soil GHG reductions associated with the adoption of one or more CSA practices in maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) crop production fields. Site-specific, multi-year DeNintrification-DeComposition model simulations were performed on agricultural fields within 11 U.S. Corn-Belt states that were identified to be in maize or soybean production from 2013 to 2016. Differences between modeled changes in SOC stocks to a depth of 50 cm, N2O emissions, and CH4 fluxes corresponding with alternative land management scenarios simulated across field sites were converted to a CO2 equivalent basis and spatially weighted to a county-scale to highlight regional variability. County-scale GHG reductions corresponding with a conversion from conventional tillage to no-tillage practices are estimated to be have a mean reduction potential of 1477 kg CO2e ha−1 yr−1 (SOC, N2O, and CH4 flux reductions of 945, 549, −17 kg CO2e ha−1yr−1, respectively, where a negative reduction indicates an increase in emissions.) with a standard deviation of 605 kg CO2e ha−1 yr−1. Additionally, the adoption of cover crops is predicted to provide a mean reduction of 678 kg CO2e ha−1 yr−1 (SOC, N2O, and CH4 flux reductions of 824, -173, 26.7 kg CO2e ha−1yr−1, respectively), and improved N-fertilizer timing is estimated to mitigate 413 kg CO2e ha−1 yr−1 (SOC, N2O, and CH4 flux reductions of 75, 337, 1 kg CO2e ha−1yr−1, respectively). The adoption of multiple CSA practices is estimated to have the greatest mean reduction potential of 2861 kg CO2e ha−1 yr−1 (SOC, N2O, and CH4 flux reductions of 2210, 611, 39 kg CO2e ha−1yr−1, respectively). Use of the spatially explicit subfield modeling approach based on public data provides a relatively low-cost approach for strategically targeting CSA practices to agricultural regions where adoption is most impactful. © 2020 The Authors","Carbon sequestration; Climate smart agriculture (CSA); GHG mitigation; Soil organic carbon; Subfield scale","Agricultural robots; Amino acids; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Cultivation; Gas emissions; Grain (agricultural product); Land use; Nitrogen fixation; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Reduction; Scales (weighing instruments); Soils; Agricultural fields; Agricultural greenhouse; Conventional tillage; Land management practices; No-tillage practices; Regional variability; Soybean (Glycine max (L.)

This study aimed to integrate existing water industry, publicly available and purchased licensed datasets with the open-access Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), to establish if these datasets could be used to effectively model metaldehyde in river catchments. To achieve the study aim, a SWAT model was developed and calibrated for the River Medway catchment (UK). The results of calibration (1994–2004) and validation (2005–2016) of average daily streamflow (m3/s) showed that the SWAT model could simulate water balance well (P-factor 0.68–0.85 and R-factor 0.54–0.82, NSE 0.42–0.60). Calibration (P-factor 0.72 and R-factor 1.35, NSE 0.31) and validation (P-factor 0.49 and R-factor 1.37, NSE 0.16) for daily soluble metaldehyde (mg active ingredient) load was also satisfactory. The most sensitive pesticide parameters for metaldehyde simulation included the timing and amount of pesticide (kg/ha) applied to the hydrological response units, the pesticide percolation coefficient and pesticide application efficiency. Outputs from this research demonstrate the potential application of SWAT in large complex catchments where routine monitoring is in place, but isn't designed explicitly for the purpose of predictive modelling. The implications of this, are significant, because they suggest that SWAT could be applied universally to catchments using existing water industry datasets. This would allow more efficient use of historical datasets and would be applicable in situations where resources are not available for additional targeted monitoring programmes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Management; Metaldehyde; Pesticide; SWAT; Water framework directive","Agricultural robots; Calibration; Catchments; Metals; Pesticides; Runoff; Solvents; Emerging contaminant; Hydrological response unit; Monitoring programmes; Percolation coefficient; Pesticide applications; Predictive modelling; Soil and water assessment tool; Soil and Water assessment tools; Predictive analytics; metaldehyde; pesticide; acetaldehyde; metaldehyde; water; aldehyde; calibration; catchment; data set; hydrological response; prediction; river basin; soil and water assessment tool; streamflow; water industry; agricultural land; Article; calibration; catchment area (hydrology); crop rotation; environmental monitoring; fluid balance; hydrological model; parameters; prediction; priority journal; river basin; simulation; Soil and Water Assessment Tool model; validation study; water supply; river; soil; theoretical model; water pollutant; England; Medway River; United Kingdom; Acetaldehyde; Models, Theoretical; Rivers; Soil; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087307743

Ecological risk assessment of single Plant Protection Products (PPPs) requires an understanding of the exposure and toxicity. In silico tools such as QSAR models can play a major role for the prediction of structural, physico-chemical and pharmacokinetic properties of chemicals as well as toxicity of single and multiple chemicals. Here, the first integrative honey bee QSAR model has been developed for PPPs using EFSA's OpenFoodTox, US-EPA ECOTOX and Pesticide Properties DataBase i) to predict acute contact toxicity (LD50) and ii) to profile the Mode of Action (MoA) of pesticides active substances. Three different classification-based and four regression-based models were developed and tested for their performance, thus identifying two models providing the most reliable predictions based on k-NN algorithm. The two-category QSAR model (toxic/non-toxic; n = 411) was validated using sensitivity (=0.93), specificity (=0.85), balanced accuracy (=0.90), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC = 0.78) as statistical parameters. The regression-based model (n = 113) was validated for its reliability and robustness (R2 = 0.74; MAE = 0.52). Current study proposes the MoA profiling for 113 pesticides active substances and the first harmonised MoA classification scheme for acute contact toxicity in honey bees, including LD50s data points from three different databases. The classification allows to further define MoAs and the target site of PPPs active substances, thus enabling regulators and scientists to refine chemical grouping and toxicity extrapolations for single chemicals and component-based mixture risk assessment of multiple chemicals. Relevant future perspectives are briefly addressed to integrate MoA, adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) and toxicokinetic information for the refinement of single-chemical/combined toxicity predictions and risk estimates at different levels of biological organization in the bee health context. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Chemical mixtures; Ecological risk assessment; Honey bees; Mode of action; QSAR models","Agricultural robots; Birds; Classification (of information); Data curation; Database systems; Ecosystems; Environmental Protection Agency; Food products; Forecasting; Health risks; Indicators (chemical); Molecular graphics; Nearest neighbor search; Open Data; Pattern recognition; Pesticides; Risk assessment; Toxicity; Biological organization; Classification scheme; Correlation coefficient; Ecological risk assessment; Pharmacokinetic properties; Regression-based model; Reliability and robustness; Statistical parameters; Computational chemistry; pesticide; pesticide; algorithm; computer simulation; ecosystem service; honeybee; numerical model; parameter estimation; pesticide; physiological response; regression analysis; toxicity; accuracy; adverse outcome pathway; Apis mellifera; Article; chemical analysis; controlled study; correlation coefficient; data analysis; data base; ecotoxicity; environmental parameters; environmental protection; food poisoning; honeybee; k nearest neighbor; LD50; mode of action classification; prediction; priority journal; quantitative structure activity relation; regression analysis; reliability; risk assessment; sensitivity and specificity; software; statistical parameters; toxicokinetics; toxicological parameters; United States; validation study; animal; bee; ecosystem; information processing; quantitative structure activity relation; reproducibility; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Animals; Bees; Data Curation; Ecosystem; Pesticides; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085321096

These urbanization processes put pressure on farmers, making farming activities harder through reduced agricultural land, negative externalities and the competition for land. To estimate possible future changes, an agricultural agent-based model was combined with spatially explicit urbanization scenarios and with different agricultural subsidizing policies for the case study of Belgium. As a result of an aging farming population and low succession rates, simulations until 2035 showed a continuous decline of farmers in all scenarios; a trend that will continue for as long as not every farmer that quits his activities is replaced. The results also showed that these declines are expected to be higher in the rural-urban fringe. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agent-based model; Agriculture; scenarios; urbanization","agricultural land; agricultural policy; modeling; scenario analysis; urbanization; Belgium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086945582

In the future, government policies may affect practices of antimicrobial use in beef production in feedlots, a prominent current user of antimicrobials in animal agriculture, but also the agricultural industry generating the highest cash receipt in the U.S. Our objective was to estimate the cost effect from the following policies in feedlots: 1) using antimicrobials for disease prevention, control, and treatment; 2) using antimicrobials only for treatment of disease; and 3) not using antimicrobials for any reason. We modelled a typical U.S. feedlot, where high risk cattle may be afflicted by diseases requiring antimicrobial therapy, namely respiratory diseases, liver abscesses and lameness. We calculated the net revenue loss under each policy of antimicrobial use restriction. With moderate disease incidence, the median net revenue loss was $66 and $96 per animal entering the feedlot, for not using antimicrobials for disease prevention and control, or not using any antimicrobials, respectively, compared to using antimicrobials for disease prevention, control, and treatment. Losses arose mainly from an increase of fatality and morbidity rates, almost doubling for respiratory diseases in the case of antimicrobial use restrictions. In the case of antimicrobial use prohibition, decreasing the feeder cattle price by 9%, or alternatively, increasing the slaughter cattle price by 6.3%, would offset the net revenue losses for the feedlot operator. If no alternatives to antimicrobial therapy for prevention, control and treatment of current infectious diseases are implemented, policies that economically incentivize adoption of non-antimicrobial prevention and control strategies for infectious diseases would be necessary to maintain animal welfare and the profitability of beef production while simultaneously curbing antimicrobial use.

Hashtgerd plain is an immigrant destination due to socio-economic development and its proximity to the Tehran metropolis. The population growth has led to more water demand, resulting in excessive utilization of groundwater resources and water shortages in the agricultural sector. The water shortage and climate change in Hashtgerd plain could lead to more severe water crisis in the future. Therefore, this study aimed to provide adaptation strategies for minimizing the negative effects of climate change by taking into account the interaction between different sub-systems in Hashtgerd plain during 2020–2049 period. In order to assess the climate change impacts, the output of 19 AOGCMs models was used under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. A comprehensive model was developed based on the system dynamics theory to investigate the interactions of water resources, agriculture, and socio-economic sub-systems and were used to investigate the impacts of climate change and evaluate various adaptation strategies on different sub-systems of the region. The simulation results showed the negative effects of climate change will intensify the water shortage in Hashtgerd Plain. The agricultural sector will be more vulnerable to climate change than the domestic and industrial sectors. The results of various policies showed that improving water use efficiency coupled with reducing the cultivation of high-consumption crops and changing the cropping pattern towards lower water requirement plants can effectively minimize the adverse impacts of climate change on water shortages in agriculture. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; System dynamics; Water shortage","Agricultural robots; Climate models; Cultivation; Economics; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Population statistics; Water supply; Adaptation strategies; Agricultural sector; Climate change impact; Comprehensive model; Socio-economic development; Water resources planning and managements; Water resources systems; Water use efficiency; Climate change; adaptive management; agriculture; climate change; climate effect; megacity; policy analysis; resource scarcity; suburban area; water resource; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Tehran [Tehran (PRV)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089783126

This sector has been challenged by the increasing number of pests including weeds. Chemicals such as herbicides are therefore used for weed control. One of such herbicides is glyphosate. The use of herbicides has however been associated with the population decline of non-target organisms like frogs. In this study, fate, transport, and effects of glyphosate on population dynamics of frogs (Crinia insignifera) were simulated using an object-oriented model known as PestTox. Two scenarios were simulated; the agricultural field and the receiving water body (stream or pond) were separated by buffer zones of 30 m and 0 m. The simulation was done using weather conditions of Pathumthani province (Thailand) for the year 2012. Results show that if the field is not surrounded by a buffer zone of at least 30 m, spray drifts and runoffs could transfer glyphosate off the field edge to the receiving waterbody, potentially killing all tadpoles only if glyphosate concentrations are sufficiently high. Results indicate that buffer zones should be used around the fields to reduce spray drifts and runoffs which in turn could help to maintain the healthy population of frogs and other non-target organisms. This study has potential limitations. First, the study used secondary data from various sources. Second, numerous processes are based on analytical expressions/regressions from various pedoclimatical contexts. These may have influenced model estimates. However, the findings may be of interest to those involved in pesticide registration and monitoring. © 2020 Greater Mekong Subregion Academic and Research Network, Asian Institute of Technology.","Ecological modeling; Object-oriented modeling; Population dynamics; Predictive modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088782252

This study aimed to assess cumulative aggregate exposure to cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin and permethrin in adults in France and the associated health risk, and to identify major contributions of exposure sources and routes. External chronic exposures were estimated from dietary and several environmental sources for the oral, inhalation and dermal routes. Internal concentrations of five associated metabolites were simulated with a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model. The predicted urinary concentrations were in same order of magnitude as those of the French ENNS biomonitoring survey. Dietary exposure, especially from cereals and animal products, was the major source of exposure. For the 1% of adults most highly exposed, dermal exposure to permethrin through medicinal and veterinary products was an important source of exposure. Considering alterations of motor, sensory and autonomic division, all individual margins of exposure were higher than 100, suggesting that no neurotoxic risk associated with the cumulative aggregate exposure to these four pyrethroids is expected for the French adult population. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cumulative aggregate exposure; Diet; Environmental health; Neurotoxicity; Pesticides; Physiologically based pharmacokinetic model","cyfluthrin; cypermethrin; deltamethrin; permethrin; pyrethroid; insecticide; pyrethroid; adult; ambient air; animal product; Article; autonomic nervous system; biological monitoring; cereal; concentration (parameter); dietary exposure; female; food intake; Frenchman; human; male; metabolite; motor system; neurotoxicity; prediction; risk assessment; sensory system; simulation; biological model; diet; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; food contamination; France; risk assessment; Adult; Diet; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Food Contamination; France; Humans; Insecticides; Models, Biological; Pyrethrins; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087725882

Three samples showed oxytetracycline respectively at 15.05, 0.82 and 1.59 ppb and two cefapirin and spyramycin at trace level. False positives with an acceptable frequency were observed by using the 3 kits confirming this approach useful for monitoring plans. Considering lincomycin, negative effect was demonstrated toward lactic acid bacteria activity in term of bacteria counts, pH and acidity during cheese making simulation.

An economic survey based on interviews shows that the use of straw mulch in olive plantation would cost €174.7 ha−1, from which €54.7 ha−1 is needed for the application work, €52.3 ha−1 for the purchase cost, and €67.7 ha−1 for the transport of 20-kg bales. The cost of the straw is 22.5% of the total income of the farmers. We found that their perception was negative about the use of straw mulch, as the tradition is to keep the soil clean from any weed or cover, except the crop. However, farmers would use it if they would be subsidized with a minimum of €267 ha−1, which is €92 ha−1 more than the costs estimated on the basis of the surveys.

This article uses the agent-based model AgriPoliS to study the effects of the availability of potential successors in two agricultural regions, one in Belgium (Flanders) and one in eastern Germany (the Altmark). The analysis provides no indication that considerably fewer successors would threaten the ability of the farming systems to ensure an adequate provision of private and public goods. Most farm closures occur due to the low efficiency of some farms which hinders the ability of famers to cover true long-term opportunity costs, i.e. the possibility of earning a higher income outside agriculture. In both study regions, a lack of successors leads to adaptations which create new opportunities for other farms and, in Flanders, to higher economic prosperity at the regional level. The adaptations differ between regions due to existing farm structures, labour demands and costs, institutional frameworks, and the ability to exploit economies of scale. The results of the simulations challenge the notion central to many CAP policies – that more farm succession is better for European agriculture. These findings call for a contextualised reconsideration of agricultural policies which support structural change and regional growth – not hinder it. © 2020 The Authors.

However, groundwater storage in the CV has been declining by around 3 km3/year over the last several decades, with much larger declines during the 2007–2009 and 2012–2015 droughts. Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) can potentially mitigate existing overdraft by recharging excess streamflows (during flood periods) to the aquifers. However, the degree to which the existing CV groundwater overdraft might be mitigated by MAR is unknown. We applied a coupled surface water-groundwater simulation model to quantify the potential for groundwater overdraft recovery via MAR. To quantify the potential benefit of MAR, we used the coupled surface water-groundwater model to simulate water allocation scenarios where streamflow above the 90th or 80th percentiles was reallocated to aquifers, subject to constraints on the maximum depth of applied water (0.61 and 3.05 m). Our results show that MAR could recover 9–22% of the existing groundwater overdraft CV-wide based on a 56-year simulation (1960–2015). However, the impact of MAR varies strongly among regions. In the southern CV where groundwater depletion is most serious, the contribution of MAR to the overdraft recovery would be small, only 2.7–3.2% in the Tulare basin and 3.2–7.8% in the San Joaquin basin. However, transferring excess winter flow from the northern to the southern CV for MAR would increase the overdraft recovery to 30% in San Joaquin and 62% in Tulare. Our results also indicate that MAR has the potential to supplement summer low flows (52–73%, CV-wide) and reduce flood peaks. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

Simulation models can facilitate exploration of system behavior under novel conditions, and participatory modeling can involve stakeholders in developing appropriate management processes. Participatory modeling already typically involves qualitative structural validation of models with stakeholders, but with increased data and more sophisticated models, quantitative behavioral validation may be possible as well. In this study, we created a novel agent-based-model applied to a specific context: Zimbabwean non-governmental organization the Muonde Trust has been collecting data on their agro-pastoral system for the last 35 years and had concerns about land-use planning and the effectiveness of management interventions in the face of climate change. We collaboratively created an agent-based model of their system using their data archive, qualitatively calibrating it to the observed behavior of the real system without tuning any parameters to match specific quantitative outputs. We then behaviorally validated the model using quantitative community-based data and conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the relative impact of underlying parameter assumptions, Indigenous management interventions, and different rainfall variation scenarios. We found that our process resulted in a model which was successfully structurally validated and sufficiently realistic to be useful for Muonde researchers as a discussion tool. The model was inconsistently behaviorally validated, however, with some model variables matching field data better than others. We observed increased model system instability due to increasing variability in underlying drivers (rainfall), and also due to management interventions that broke feedbacks between the components of the system. Interventions that smoothed year-to-year variation rather than exaggerating it tended to improve sustainability. The Muonde trust has used the model to successfully advocate to local leaders for changes in land-use planning policy that will increase the sustainability of their system. © 2020 Eitzel et al.

Improving agriculture in Upper Egypt is necessary, as farmers in this region need to meet the quality standards required by international markets if they are to increase export volumes. For this reason, agricultural interventions are required to transition from the current traditional farming systems and marketing practices to sustainable conservation farming practices and the use of market intelligence and logistics. The main aim of this research study is to assess the potential for improving the livelihoods of rural communities by conducting a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and conducting a risk analysis using the Monte Carlo simulation method for the proposed agricultural interventions. Our results imply that the analyzed interventions are viable from both a financial and socio-economic point of view. The impacts of the interventions reveal real incremental employment opportunities at the farming level. In addition, the interventions have a very low probability of negative returns and become almost zero when we add the economic benefit to society. © 2020 by the authors.","Cost-benefit analysis (CBA); Job opportunities; Monte carlo simulation; Risk analysis; Socio-economic; Sustainable livelihoods","agricultural practice; alternative agriculture; assessment method; farming system; livelihood; market conditions; rural population; socioeconomic conditions; sustainability; Egypt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089795451

As a powerful tool, feedforward neural network (FNN) was applied to study seawater intrusion area (SIA) fluctuations in Longkou, China. In the present study, changes of groundwater level (GWL) were modeled by FNN Model 1. Then, FNN Model 2 was developed for fitting the relationship between GWL and SIA. Finally, two models were integrated to simulate SIA changes in response to climatic and artificial factors. The sensitivity analysis of each impact factor was conducted by the ""stepwise"" method to quantify the relative importance for SIA and GWL. The results from the integrated model indicated that this method could accurately reproduce SIA fluctuations when the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient was 0.964, the root mean square error was 1.052 km2, the correlation coefficient was 0.983, and the mean absolute error was 0.782 km2. The results of sensitivity analysis prove that precipitation and groundwater pumping for agriculture mainly affect fluctuations of SIA in the study area. It can be concluded that FNN is effectively used for modeling SI fluctuations together with GWL, which can provide enough support for the sustainable management of groundwater resources with consideration of crucial impact factors of seawater intrusion (SI). © 2020 by the authors.","Feedforward neural network; Seawater intrusion area; Sensitivity analysis; Simulation","Agricultural robots; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Mean square error; Salt water intrusion; Seawater effects; Sensitivity analysis; Correlation coefficient; Efficiency coefficient; Groundwater pumping; Integrated modeling; Mean absolute error; Root mean square errors; Sustainable groundwater; Sustainable management; Feedforward neural networks; artificial neural network; correlation; groundwater resource; precipitation (climatology); saline intrusion; sensitivity analysis; simulation; China; Longkou; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089692379

The Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM) was evaluated using production, economic, and weather data collected on two cooperating farms in the Legal Amazon and Cerrado biomes in the Midwest state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Three sustainable agricultural intensification strategies, namely grain supplementation, pasture re-seeding, and pasture fertilization were simulated in IFSM with double the beef cattle stocking density compared to extensive grazing. Livestock dry matter consumption simulated in IFSM was similar for pasture grazing estimates and actual feed consumed by beef cattle on the two collaborating farms. Grain supplementation best balanced beef production and profitability with lower carbon footprint compared to extensive grazing, followed by pasture fertilization and pasture re-seeding. However, pasture re-seeding and fertilization had greater use of water and energy and more nitrogen losses. Human edible livestock feed use was greatest for grain supplementation compared to other modeled systems. While grain supplementation appears more favorable economically and environmentally, greater use of human edible livestock feed may compete with future human food needs. Pasture intensification had greater human edible feed conversion efficiency, but its greater natural resource use may be challenging. © 2020 by the authors.

This literature focuses overwhelmingly on the impact of elevated CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, higher temperatures and changing precipitation on staple crop yields. While critically important for food security, we argue that researchers have gravitated to measuring impacts ‘under the streetlight’ where data and models are plentiful. We argue that prior work has largely neglected the vast majority of potential economic impacts of climate change on agriculture. A broader view must extend the impacts analysis to inputs beyond land, including the consequences of climate change for labor productivity, as well as for purchased intermediate inputs. Largely overlooked is the impact of climate change on the rate of total factor productivity growth and the potential for more rapid depreciation of the underlying knowledge capital underpinning this key driver of agricultural output growth. This broader view must also focus more attention on non-staple crops, which, while less important from a caloric point of view, are critically important in redressing current micronutrient deficiencies in many diets around the world. The paper closes with numerical simulations that demonstrate the extent to which limited input and output coverage of climate impacts can lead to considerable underestimation of the consequences for food security and economic welfare. Of particular significance is the finding that humans in the humid tropics are likely more vulnerable to heat stress than are many of the well-adapted crops, such as rice. By omitting the impact of heat stress on humans, most studies of climate impacts greatly understate the welfare losses in the world's poorest economies. © 2020 The Author(s)","Agriculture; Climate impacts; Heat stress; Nutrition; Productivity","carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; developing world; economic impact; farming system; food security; labor productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089293066

Sustainable agricultural practices based on low-external input is of paramount importance for reducing environmental trade-offs and planet healthy food production. Therefore, a critical assessment was made on viable low-input technologies aimed to reduce the negative effects of agricultural production as well as the use of various crop simulation models for forecasting the agricultural production under changing climatic scenario. While crop simulation models are helpful for predicting the growth and yield of individual crops under current as well as futuristic scenarios, it is difficult to model the response of multiple cropping systems under changing climatic conditions. As a matter of fact, the developing countries, majorly dependent on agriculture are most vulnerable to climate change. The increasing price of agrochemicals is another setback for subsistence farmers in resource-poor nations. In this backdrop, the current review aimed to assess the impact of climate change on agriculture, and the role of low input sustainable agriculture (LISA) for ensuring the food security while safeguarding the critical natural resources for human-wellbeing and also for attaining UN-Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, evidence-based impacts of LISA in emerging economies from Africa and South Asia are highlighted and suitable ecological indicators for measuring the sustainability of such LISA are addressed in brief. We conclude that the large-scale implementation of LISA will facilitate agricultural sustainability, and therefore, suitable policy frameworks are imperative for its worldwide adoption. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Climate change; Low input sustainable agriculture; Simulation models; Sustainability indicators; UN-Sustainable Development Goals","Agricultural chemicals; Agricultural robots; Crops; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Food supply; Forestry; Soil quality; Sustainable development; Agricultural productions; Agricultural sustainability; Crop simulation model; Ecological indicators; Global sustainability; Multiple cropping systems; Sustainable agricultural; Sustainable agriculture; Climate change; agricultural practice; agricultural production; alternative agriculture; climate change; environmental factor; farming system; food production; population growth; soil degradation; soil quality; sustainability; sustainable development; trade-off; warming; Africa; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083514924

The aim of the Agrimonde-Terra foresight study was to build global scenarios linking land use and food security, with special attention paid to overlooked aspects such as nutrition and health, in order to help explore the possible future of the global food system. In this article, we seek to highlight how the resulting set of scenarios contributes to the debate on land use and food security and enlarges the range of possible futures for the global food system. We highlight four main contributions. Combining a scenario building method based on morphological analysis and quantitative simulations with a tractable and simple biomass balance model, the proposed approach improves transparency and coherence between scenario narratives and quantitative assessment. Agrimonde-Terra's scenarios comprise a wide range of alternative diets, with contrasting underlying nutritional and health issues, which accompany contrasting urbanization and rural transformation processes, both dimensions that are lacking in other sets of global scenarios. Agrimonde-Terra's scenarios share some similarities with existing sets of global scenarios, notably the SSPs, but are usually less optimistic regarding agricultural land expansion up to 2050. Results suggest that changing global diets toward healthier patterns could also help to limit the expansion in agricultural land area. Agrimonde-Terra's scenarios enlarge the scope of possible futures by proposing two pathways that are uncommon in other sets of global scenarios. The first proposes to explore possible reconnection of the food industry and regional production within supranational regional blocs. The second means that we should consider that a 'perfect storm', induced by climate change and an ecological crisis combined with social and economic crises, is still possible. Both scenarios should be part of the debate as the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic shows. © 2020 Mora et al.

However, with global climate change, extreme weather has become an exogenous factor that cannot be ignored, as it affects agricultural production. Most of the existing studies only consider the domestic natural resources and economic factors, without fully considering the external climate factors. This paper uses the super undesirable dynamic Slacks-Based Measures (SBM) under an exogenous variable model to simulate the external environmental factors by adding extreme weather days. The Dagum Gini coefficient and kernel density estimation are used to explore the regional differences in agricultural production in China. The results show that the agricultural production efficiency is higher in the eastern region, and the difference in agricultural production efficiency among the provinces in the middle and western regions is large, showing a trend of polarization. The difference in the Gini coefficient between the middle and western regions is more significant. The main contribution factor of the Dagum Gini coefficient is the inter-regional difference. The regional concentration degree of agriculture in China is decreasing, the regional distribution of agricultural water resources is more balanced, and the national regional difference gradually decreases. Finally, some suggestions are put forward, such as extreme weather control, agricultural water supply, and water-saving measures. © 2020 by the authors.

The input parameters for soil hydraulic, soil solution, and cation exchange data were determined for 14 soil profiles from the NAP region. For a warm-up period from 1970 to 2017, the model used historical climate data and low-salinity irrigation water. In the subsequent period (2018-2050), irrigation continued with RCW and projected meteorological conditions were obtained by considering expected future climate change. The average soil water salinity (ECsw) at the end of the simulation period ranged from 2.9-10.5 dS/m across all soils and crops. Potential yields of salt-sensitive crops such as annual horticulture and almonds were reduced by 4-32% due to increased salinity in the soil. Similarly, the model predicted that the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) would increase above threshold values, typically considered as indicative of poor growing conditions for most crops. Relationships between SAR and ESP were developed for four representative soils, providing the threshold soil SAR that corresponds to a critical ESP (&gt;6), which would lead to adverse soil health and crop growth impacts. Threshold SARs were derived for calcareous (SAR = 4), hard red-brown (SAR = 3.5), sand over clay (SAR = 6), and deep uniform to gradational (SAR = 3) soils. An increase in SAR and ESP in soils adversely affects soil structural stability and soil water movement, which can severely impact the sustainable crop production in the NAP region. Relationships such as those between SAR and ESP help in identifying critical soil constraints and assist in devising better guidelines for the sustainable use of recycled water for irrigated agriculture. © 2020","ESP; horticultural crops; HYDRUS-1D; irrigation; Recycled water; salinity; SAR; UNSATCHEM","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Irrigation; Sodium; Soil moisture; Stability; Exchangeable sodium percentages; Irrigated agriculture; Meteorological condition; Salt-sensitive crops; Sodium adsorption ratio; Soil chemical property; Soil structural stability; Variably saturated flow; Water recycling; chemical property; crop production; crop yield; growth; horticulture; irrigation system; pasture; soil chemistry; soil water; synthetic aperture radar; viticulture; Adelaide; Australia; South Australia; Allium cepa; Daucus carota; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083038732

In this study, a HYDRUS-1D model was adopted to explore water content and NO3 − distribution in the unsaturated zone above groundwater table in an agricultural area. The resulting estimates of water flux and NO3 − leaching through the unsaturated zone were used as input data in the application of the groundwater flow model Visual MODFLOW and mass transport model MT3DMS via a concentration recharge boundary. Nitrate leaching occurred mainly between May and September, accounting for 64% of the annual total. Four fertilizer application scenarios were developed, and their effects were compared in predictive simulations of groundwater NO3 − concentrations using MT3DMS and quantitative analysis of NO3 −-contaminated areas, the spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater NO3 − concentration using ArcGIS. Predictions in the business as usual (scenario 1) showed that NO3 − continued to accumulate in groundwater in the study area, with the maximum increased from 14 to 18 mg L−1 in 10 years. In the scenario 2 (2% increase in fertilizer application rate), peak groundwater NO3 − was expected to exceed 20 mg L−1 in 2027. However, in both scenarios 3 (2% reduction in fertilizer application) and 4 (4% reduction in fertilization), the maximal NO3 − concentrations were predicted to be lower than 12 mg L−1 in 2027.

We integrate agronomic and economic simulation models to determine the expected yield increase from biochar applications in the United States. We calculate the location-specific willingness to pay of U.S. farmers to apply biochar to their cropland if biochar increases yields over 20 years. In addition to the potential benefit of higher revenue for farmers, biochar applications also have policy implications if biochar production is combined with bio-fuel production or used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from indirect land-use change. Thus, the results are then combined with an agricultural outlook model to determine the effects on global land-use change and net carbon emissions. Our results indicate that biochar application is most profitable for croplands in the Southeast U.S. due to the combination of high yield increases and availability of biomass to produce biochar. An increase in U.S. yields above trend by 1% for corn, soybeans, and wheat would decrease net total global emissions by 25–87 Tg of CO2-equivalent. © 2020","Agricultural trade; Biomass; Carbon capture and utilization; Mitigation technologies; Net present value; Pyrolysis","Agriculture; Biomass; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Pyrolysis; Agricultural land; Carbon emissions; Economic simulation; Indirect land-use changes; Net present value; Policy implications; Potential benefits; Willingness to pay; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080040748

Although the SJRB was selected in this case study, many of the same resource management issues are being played out in arid, agricultural regions around the world. The first part of this paper provides an introduction to some of the early issues impacting the expansion of irrigated agriculture primarily on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley and the policy and capital investments that were used to address salinity impairments to the use of the San Joaquin River (SJR) as an irrigation water supply. Irrigated agriculture requires large quantities of water if it is to be sustained, as well as supply water of adequate quality for the crop being grown. The second part of the paper addresses these supply issues and a period of excessive groundwater pumping that resulted in widespread land subsidence. A joint federal and state policy response that resulted in the facilities to import Delta water provided a remedy that lasted almost 50 years until the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014 was passed in the legislature to address a recurrence of the same issue. The paper describes the current state of basin-scale simulation modeling that many areas, including California, are using to craft a future sustainable groundwater resource management policy. The third section of the paper deals with unique water quality issues that arose in connection with the selenium crisis at Kesterson Reservoir and the significant threats to irrigation sustainability on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley that followed. The eventual policy response to this crisis was incremental, spanning two decades of University of California-led research programs focused on finding permanent solutions to the salt and selenium contamination problems constraining irrigated agriculture, primarily on the west side. Arid-zone agricultural drainageinduced water quality problems are becoming more ubiquitous worldwide. One policy approach that found traction in California is an innovative variant on the traditional Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) approach to salinity regulation, which has features in common with a scheme in Australia's Hunter River Basin. The paper describes the real-time salinity management (RTSM) concept, which is geared to improving coordination of west side agricultural and wetland exports of salt load with east side tributary reservoir release flows to improve compliance with river salinity objectives. RTSM is a concept that requires access to continuous flow and electrical conductivity data from sensor networks located along the San Joaquin River and its major tributaries and a simulation model-based decision support designed to make salt load assimilative capacity forecasts. Web-based information dissemination and data sharing innovations are described with an emphasis on experience with stakeholder engagement and participation. The last decade has seen wide-scale, global deployment of similar technologies for enhancing irrigation agriculture productivity and protecting environmental resources. © 2020 by the authors.

Exposure to heat stress is increasing with rising global temperatures. While most studies assessing future heat stress have focused on surface air temperature, compound extremes of heat and humidity are key drivers of heat stress. Here, we use atmospheric reanalysis data and a large initial-condition ensemble of global climate model simulations to evaluate future changes in daily compound heat-humidity extremes as a function of increasing global-mean surface air temperature (GSAT). The changing frequency of heat-humidity extremes, measured using wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), is strongly related to GSAT and, conditional upon GSAT, nearly independent of forcing pathway. The historical ∼1°C of GSAT increase above preindustrial levels has already increased the population annually exposed to at least one day with WBGT exceeding 33°C (the reference safety value for humans at rest per the ISO-7243 standard) from 97 million to 275 million. Maintaining the current population distribution, this exposure is projected to increase to 508 million with 1.5°C of warming, 789 million with 2.0°C of warming, and 1.22 billion with 3.0°C of warming (similar to late-century warming projected based on current mitigation policies). © 2020 The Author(s).

Although many studies have examined the participation decisions of forest farm households in afforestation programs, these studies fail to consider different types of these policies. This paper fills this knowledge gap by studying the determinants of forest farms participating in two afforestation programs on plain and sloped land in Taiwan. We construct a population-based sample of forest farms drawn from agricultural census surveys in Taiwan and estimate the multinomial logit model. We find that failing to distinguish between afforestation programs may result in misleading findings. Moreover, socio-demographic and farm production characteristics also affect participation decisions. Additional results from a simple simulation exercise show that forest farms are more likely to enroll in afforestation programs on sloped land, possibly due to lower opportunity costs. © 2020 by the authors.

Five scenarios of land use and resource management practices for maize production were modelled. The business-as-usual scenario was based on primary data, which were collected using semi-structured questionnaires administered to 56 small-scale maize farmers through personal interviews. The dominant land use was characterised by an external input ≤12 kg/ha/yr inorganic fertilizer with/without the addition of manure in rainfed maize systems. The project scenarios were based on APSIM simulations of maize yield response to 0, 20, 50 and 100 kg/ha/yr urea dosages, with/without supplemental irrigation. The scenarios were dubbed as follows: (1) no/low input systems were denoted by Extensive0, Extensive12, and Intercrop20, and (2) moderate/high input systems were denoted by Intensive50, and Intensive100. The EM-DEA approach was used to assess the resource use efficiency (RUE) and sustainability in maize production systems, Ghana. The measured RUE and sustainability were used as a proxy for further analyses by applying the environmental CBA and VCA approaches to calculate: (a) the environmental costs of producing maize, i.e. resource use measured as total emergy (U), and (b) benefits from the yielded maize, i.e. (b i) food provision from grain measured in kcal/yr, and (b ii) potential electricity (bioenergy) which could be generated from residue measured in MWh/yr. The information which was derived from the applications of the EM-DEA, CBA and VCA approaches was aggregated by applying the SBSC approach to do a sustainability appraisal of the scenarios. The results show that, when labour and services are included in the assessment of RUE and sustainability, Intercrop20 and Intensive50 achieved greater marginal yield, better RUE, sustainability and appraisal score. The same scenarios caused lesser impacts in terms of expansion of area cultivated compared to Extensive0 and Extensive12. Meanwhile the impacts of Intercrop20 and Intensive50 in terms of ecotoxicity, emissions, and demand for resources (energy, materials, labour and services) were lesser compared to Intensive100. The implications of the various scenarios are discussed. The environmental performance of the scenarios are compared to maize production systems in other developing regions in order to put this study within a broader context. We conclude that, the EM-DEA approach is useful for assessing RUE and sustainability of agricultural production systems at farm and regional scales, as well as in connecting the management planning level and regional development considerations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Emergy-Data envelopment analysis; Environment-biomass-food-energy nexus; Food security; Strategic land use planning; Sub-Saharan Africa; Sustainable agriculture","agricultural development; agricultural management; alternative agriculture; cost-benefit analysis; crop production; data envelopment analysis; environmental values; food security; land use planning; maize; multicriteria analysis; Ghana; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082011831

To quantify the potential nutrient removal function of ditches and ponds that naturally existed in rice growing regions, a representative paddy irrigation and drainage unit (IDU) composed of fields, ditches and a pond in the one-season rice region of the middle Changjiang River basin, China was monitored for two years. With data and knowledge gained, a Water Quantity and Quality Model for Paddy IDUs (WQQM-PIDU) is developed and applied for 30 years simulation to produce a general view. The monitored and modelled results showed that nutrient concentration peaks after fertilization was delayed and lowered in ditches and ponds, compared to those in paddy fields. Concentrations of runoff from the IDU outlet were generally lower than from the field during the whole rice growing season except the transplanting period. If fully utilized as temporary reservoirs, ditches and ponds naturally existed in a typical paddy IDU would reduce 39% nitrogen loads from field edges with a range of 17%–93% and 28% phosphorus loads with a range of 12%–92%. Although typical paddy IDUs discharge fewer nutrient loads than the content input into them, the discharge concentrations may be risky to surface waters. For their nutrient removal function, natural ditches and ponds are recommended to be included into irrigation and drainage management with accurate water level management during drainage, which is a promising and cost-effective approach to enhance surface water quality in rice growing regions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Ditch; Drainage; Irrigation; Non-point source pollution; Paddy field; Pond","Catchments; Cost effectiveness; Drainage; Irrigation; Nutrients; Ponding; Ponds; Reservoirs (water); River pollution; Water levels; Water pollution control; Water quality; Changjiang River basin; Cost-effective approach; Discharge concentration; Ditch; Non-point source pollution; Nutrient concentrations; Paddy fields; Water level managements; Lakes; nitrogen; phosphorus; surface water; drainage; irrigation; paddy field; source apportionment; surface water; water management; water quality; agricultural land; Article; concentration (parameter); controlled study; irrigation (agriculture); paddy field; pond; priority journal; runoff; waste component removal; waste water management; water quality; China; Yangtze Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079586754

This citizen science study assessed preschool children's potential arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) exposure via locally grown produce, water, incidental soil ingestion, and dust inhalation at four sites. Participants were trained to properly collect water, soil, and vegetable samples from their preschools in Nevada County, California. As, Cd, and Pb concentrations in irrigation sources did not exceed the U.S. EPA's maximum contaminant and action levels. In general, garden and playground As and Pb soil concentrations exceeded the U.S. EPA Regional Screening Level, CalEPA Human Health Screening Level, and California Department of Toxic Substances Control Screening Level. In contrast, all Cd concentrations were below these recommended screening levels. Dust samples (<10 μm diameter) were generated from surface garden and playground soil collected at the preschools by a technique that simulated windblown dust. Soil and dust samples were then analyzed by in-vitro bioaccessibility assays using synthetic lung and gastric fluids to estimate the bioaccessible fraction of As, Cd, and Pb in the body. Metal(loid) exposure via grown produce revealed that lettuce, carrot, and cabbage grown in the preschool gardens accumulated a higher concentration of metal(loid) than those store-bought nation-wide. None of the vegetables exceeded the respective recommendation maximum levels for Cd and Pb set by the World Health Organization Codex Alimentarius Commission. The results of this study indicate that consumption of preschool-grown produce and incidental soil ingestion were major contributors to preschool-aged children's exposure to As, Cd, and Pb. Traditionally, this level of site- and age-specific assessment and analyses does not occur at contaminated sites. The results of this holistic risk assessment can inform future risk assessment and public health interventions related to childhood metal(loid) exposures. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arsenic; Bioaccessibility; Cadmium; Children exposure assessment; Incidental soil ingestion; Inhalation; Lead; Mining waste; Plant uptake; Preschool gardening; Risk characterization","Arsenic; Cadmium; Dust; Health; Health risks; Lead; Metals; Risk assessment; Soils; Vegetables; Bioaccessibility; Exposure assessment; Inhalation; Mining waste; Plant uptake; Preschool gardening; Risk characterization; Soil ingestions; Pollution; arsenic; cadmium; lead; metalloid; water; metal; arsenic; cadmium; child health; concentration (composition); health impact; health risk; medical geography; public health; risk assessment; World Health Organization; Article; bioassay; cabbage; California; carrot; child; concentration (parameter); dust; environmental exposure; gardening; human; ingestion; inhalation; irrigation (agriculture); lettuce; mining; nonhuman; plant growth; preschool child; priority journal; risk assessment; simulation; surface area; vegetable; city; infant; soil pollutant; Brassica oleracea var. capitata; Daucus carota; Lactuca; California; Child; Child, Preschool; Cities; Gardening; Humans; Infant; Metals; Risk Assessment; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076541503

Specifically, the rural labor migration to cities and towns has posed a significant challenge on the contract management between household and cultivated land during agricultural modernization. The transfer of rural contracted land-use rights is gradually becoming a heat dispute in the basic rural management system. The stable land contract relationships need to be maintained in the countryside over the long term, while it also needs to strengthen supervision of and services related to the exit of rural contracted land-use rights for the standardized and intensive agriculture. During this time, the withdrawal rights of farmers' land contract can be a major management measure in China's rural land reform, in order to promote the moderate urbanization of rural land on a larger scale. In this study, seven exit modes in scenario simulations were established to analyze the exit decision-making of farmers under different conditions based on the exit policies that have been implemented in some typical pilot areas in the country. Survey questionnaires from 279 field farmers were made to clarify the influencing factors of farmers' exit decisions on different modes under scenario simulation. A single factor analysis was used to analyze the 16 potential influencing factors from the four feature dimensions in turn, where a Chi-square test was utilized to evaluate the significant level of the variables for the selection of the single factor analysis in the multiple order. A Logistic regression was used to reveal the factors that influence farmers' decision-making on the withdrawal of land contractual management rights. The results show that: 1) Under different scenarios, the interviewed farmers have various willingness to accept the exit mode. In the exit modes that implemented in Neijiang, Sichuan and Chengdu, Sichuan, farmers expressed their willingness to accept accounted for 63.08% (Neijiang mode) and 53.05% (Chengdu mode) of the total sample. The acceptance rate of farmers was similar in Pingluo mode of 16.49% and in Meitan mode of 18.28%. There was a lowest acceptance rate of farmers in the Jinhu mode. A conservative attitude can occur in the farmers' exit decisions under various scenarios. The withdrawal decision of land tenure was mainly focused on the single-item exit and long-term exit of land contractual management rights, while the exit mode of ""three rights withdrawal"" was more cautious for the farms. 2) The regression results show that there are various influencing factors of farmers' decision-making on exiting from different scenarios. The variable expected risk level has a significant impact on the exit decisions in the seven scenarios. If farmers feel that the expected risk level is relatively low, they are generally more inclined to withdraw from land contractual management rights. The ability of risk avoidance was stronger in other scenarios than that in the Wenjiang mode. If farmers think that they cannot afford the risk of exit completely, they usually choose not to quit the right of contract land. The type of household has a positive impact on the exit decisions in the Neijiang, Wenjiang and Chengdu modes, whereas, the quit willingness was even strong in the non-farm households. Whether there was abandonment or idleness in the contracted land has a significant impact on the Liangping, Meitan and Jinhu modes. Specifically, farmers with abandonment or idleness land were more willing to withdraw from land contractual management rights.

The system dynamics (SD) approach has become widely used because of its merits and benefits as a tool to deal with complex, dynamic problems and systems with many aspects and components that are involved and must be understood to ensure sound decisions regarding water and hydrological systems. Although agricultural water management needs to be studied as a main part of water management, socioeconomic management, and environmental management requiring the use of SD, this review shows that SD is currently used to a limited extent in terms of agricultural water management. This paper sheds light on the studies and investigations on the use of SD in the water sector and highlights the strengths of SD in order to encourage researchers to use this promising method to manage such a vital resource. Accordingly, this review seeks to include a comprehensive and up-to-date survey of existing publications and scholarly papers on the use of SD modeling as an effective technique for dealing with different problems associated with planning, management, and analysis of hydrology and water resources systems. Recent trends in the integration of SD with other modeling systems, such as artificial intelligence systems, are discussed along with the limitations and challenges facing application. This article makes a new contribution by giving a foundation of references and studies for scholars, researchers, and academics which encourages future investigation in employing the SD approach to hydrology and water resources management and planning, especially with agricultural water. © 2020 by the authors.","Agriculture; Hydrology; Simulation; System dynamics; Water resources","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Hydrology; System theory; Water management; Agricultural water; Agricultural water management; Artificial intelligence systems; Environmental aspects; Hydrological system; Hydrology and water resource; Socio-economic factor; Water resources management; Environmental management; artificial intelligence; decision making; environmental management; hydrology; irrigation system; socioeconomic status; water management; water resource",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085957905

Information on the crop management practices of these systems was collected on 60 farms through a questionnaire survey. Rice-bitter gourd system was observed to have the highest system yield (49.88 ± 4.34 tha−1yr−1) followed by rice-potato-ridge gourd (37.78 ± 2.77 tha−1yr−1) and rice-potato-pumpkin (36.84 ± 2.04 tha−1yr−1) systems. The rice-bitter gourd system also recorded the highest benefit:cost ratio (3.92 ± 0.061). The lowest system yield and economics were recorded in the rice-fallow-fallow system. Rice-sunflower system recorded highest specific energy (2.54 ± 0.102 MJkg−1), followed by rice-rice (2.14 ± 0.174 MJkg−1) and rice-fallow-fallow (1.91 ± 0.327 MJkg−1) systems, lowest being observed in the rice-bitter gourd (0.52 ± 0.290 MJkg−1) and rice-pointed gourd (0.52 ± 0.373 MJkg−1) systems. Yield-scaled GHGs (YSGHG) emission was highest (1.265 ± 0.29 t CO2eqt−1 system yield) for rice-fallow-fallow system and was lowest for rice-vegetable systems. To estimate the uncertainty of the YSGHG across different systems under study, Monte-Carlo Simulation was performed. It was observed that there was a 5% probability of recording YSGHG emission &gt; 1.15 t CO2eqt−1 system yield from different cropping systems in the present experiment. Multiple system properties such as productivity, economics, energy, and emission from all rice-based systems taken together, the rice-vegetable system performed consistently well across parameters and may be practised for higher economic returns with judicious and sustainable utilization of resources in the coastal saline tracts of the region. © 2020 Ray et al.

This greater information occurs by providing improved predictions of crop yields using remote sensing and crop simulation models and by allowing farms to apply inputs within the growing season when some crop conditions are already realized. We use a stylized model with uncertainty in yield and price to examine how greater information on crop conditions (i.e., a “forecast”) affects input use for insured and uninsured farms. We show that moral hazard decreases—farms apply more inputs—as the forecast accuracy improves when the forecast indicates good yields, and vice versa when the forecast indicates bad yields. In the long run, moral hazard decreases in response to an improvement in forecast accuracy. Even though moral hazard decreases in the long run, indemnity payments are likely to increase in the long run—driven by the increase in moral hazard when the forecast indicates bad crop conditions. We use the results of our model to discuss the potential impact of different technologies and types of inputs on the federal crop insurance program and the environment. © The Author(s) 2019.

The objective of the paper is to analyse the links between the EU bioeconomy strategy and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to assess what could be the main points of synergies and tensions between bioeconomy-related SDG targets. By semantically mapping the action plan of the 2018 EU bioeconomy strategy with the SDG targets, the paper finds that the bioeconomy strategy is aligned with 53 targets distributed in 12 of the 17 SDGs. Ex-post correlation analysis on bioeconomy-related SDGs indicators for 28 EU Member States (1990–2018) shows a predominance of synergies over trade-offs. More intense synergetic past developments (positive correlations) are found among clean energies (SDG 7), recycling (SDG 11), ecosystem preservation (SDG 15) and most of all other bioeconomy-related SDGs. Negative correlations are observed between agro-biodiversity (SDG 2), domestic material consumption of biomass (SDG 8 and 12), agriculture and industrial developments (SDG 2 and SDG 9) and a wide array of bioeconomy-related SDG indicators. The hotspots of strong correlations identified might be useful in further enrichment of ex-ante simulation models. From a policy coherence perspective, a wide range of policy instruments are already in place in the EU to foster synergies and may bring co-benefits. Policies oriented at preventing trade-offs are already in place but they have not overcome the antagonisms observed in this study yet. Change in practices, technical and technological innovations and the application of circular and ‘cascading principles’ are the most common fields of action. © 2020 The Authors","Bioeconomy; Biomass; Correlation; Policy coherence; SDG","Biodiversity; Biomass; Correlation methods; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; International trade; Sustainable development; Bioeconomy; Correlation analysis; Ecosystem services; Industrial development; Negative correlation; Policy instruments; Positive correlations; Technological innovation; Planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077928234

The complexity of beef systems means that appropriate GHG mitigating strategies depend on local conditions, requiring tailored entry points to be identified and evaluated. Using Scotland as a case study, here we combine a bio-economic simulation model and farm-level carbon footprinting tool to study the environmental impact of a range of beef production scenarios, and trade-offs generated between mitigating emissions and increasing farm profitability. To measure the environmental impact of finishing duration, type and gender selection of beef fattening systems, emissions were grouped into five categories: (1) land and crops, (2) enteric emissions, (3) manure, (4) feed and bedding, and (5) fuel and electricity. Results suggest that more intensive shorter duration systems have the lowest environmental impact of all the systems investigated. However, medium duration (i.e. 18–24 months) pasture-based beef production systems in Scotland were found to achieve a balance between financial returns and environmental performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Beef production systems; Carbon footprint; Environmental modelling; Greenhouse gas","Agriculture; Beef; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Environmental management; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Alternative management; Beef production; Carbon footprinting; Economic simulation; Environmental modelling; Environmental performance; Environmental sustainability; Financial returns; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077461125

In particular, accurate simulation of water content in the soil depends not only on the correct determination of the percentages of each component in the water balance but also on the measured biophysical properties of the soil available. One of the greatest man-made environmental disasters in history is the destruction of the Aral Sea which is heavily polluted. Possible scenarios have been formulated, to transfer water from the Siberian rivers to Central Asia and to limit the unsustainable extension of irrigation in this region. A new scenario proposed in this paper is partly based on the use of Caspian water evaporators located on the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea. The implementation of this scenario allows the rescue of the Aral Sea and the normalization of water balance in Central Asia. The results of the calculations show that the Aral Sea can be restored over the next 90–240 years depending on these versions. If the anthropogenic outflow of river water is further reduced by 10%, the Aral Sea will be restored for about 90 years. Finally, possible versions of the water recovery scenario are discussed and evaluated and compared with other examples such as Lake Eyre in Australia, Lake Sevan in Armenia, and Lake Chad in central Africa. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Irrigation; Modeling scenarios; Natural evaporators; Pollution; Water balance","Global warming; Restoration; Biophysical properties; Central Africa; Central Asia; Climate scenarios; Environmental disasters; Hydrological cycles; Water balance; Water recovery; Lakes; river water; biophysics; irrigation; outflow; recovery; river water; soil water; water budget; water content; water resource; agricultural land; Article; climate change; environmental change; greenhouse effect; irrigation (agriculture); simulation; water content; water cycle; water flow; water quality; water supply; water vapor; Aral Sea; Caspian Sea; Central Asia; Siberia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084737451

Pakistan is among the top ten most prone nations to CC in the world. The objective of this analysis was to quantify the economic impacts of CC on the agricultural production system and to quantify the impacts of suggested adaptation strategies at the farm level. The study was conducted in the Punjab province’s rice-wheat cropping system. For this purpose, climate modeling was carried out by using two representative concentration pathways (RCPs), i.e., RCPs 4.5 and 8.5, and five global circulation models (GCMs). The crop modeling was carried out by using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop simulation models (CSMs), which were tested on the cross-sectional data of 217 farm households collected from the seven strata in the study area. The socio-economic impacts were calculated using the Multidimensional Impact Assessment Tradeoff Analysis Model (TOA-MD). The results revealed that CC’s net economic impact using both RCPs and CSMs was negative. In both CSMs, the poverty status was higher in RCP 8.5 than in RCP 4.5. The adaptation package showed positive results in poverty reduction and improvement in the livelihood conditions of the agricultural households. The adoption rate for DSSAT was about 78%, and for APSIM, it was about 68%. The adaptation benefits observed in DSSAT were higher than in APSIM. The results showed that the suggested adaptations could have a significant impact on the resilience of the atmospheric changes.

The key to effectively break through the dilemma is to promote the co-governance of agricultural non-point source pollution control by stakeholders including local governments, new agricultural operators and traditional farmers. Accordingly, this paper discusses the interactive decision-making relationships between new agricultural operators and traditional farmers under the guidance of local governments, by constructing a trilateral evolutionary game model, as well as analyzing evolutionary cooperative stability strategies and realizing the simulation of evolution processes in different scenarios by MATLAB. The results show that new agricultural operators play a leading role in agricultural non-point source pollution control, whose strategies have effects such as technology spillover. The rewards from the superior government will support local governments in taking proactive action in the co-governance of agricultural non-point source pollution control, and then local governments can offer technical support and subsidies to new agricultural operators and traditional farmers for reducing their costs. Furthermore, this paper also finds that there are green synergy effects among the groups, where the variations of parameters and strategies by one group would affect the two others. Additionally, agricultural land operation rights transfers would cause traditional farmers to take more time to cooperate in the co-governance of agricultural non-point source pollution control. In order to promote the multi-agent co-governance of agricultural non-point source pollution control under intensive management pattern, this paper suggests that it should be necessary to reduce their costs and improve incentives, as well as to increase the common interests among groups and enhance their green synergy effects. © 2020 by the authors.

Yet, user willingness to trust forecast information is uncertain and often varied across similar user groups. Here, forecast uptake by agriculture users in semi-arid water rights managed basins is modelled to account for heterogeneous risk attitude and hydrologic variability. A season-ahead forecast of reservoir inflow is translated to water-trading rulesets through coupled reservoir allocation, i.e. per-water right allocation from the reservoir, crop-water, economic optimization, and demand derivation models. Theoretical growers, aligned in crop-type cooperatives, are modelled as potential exclusive water trading partners that, in years of scarcity may choose between forecast-informed water trading via option contracts, or one of two alternative water trade actions: persistence forecast-informed trading or no trading. Simulations across varied initial water rights endowment and farmer risk attitude allows for evaluation of expected investment of water rights in forecast-informed water trade. Results indicate farmer willingness to trust forecast information and subsequently invest rights option contracts trade is variable (28%–70%), and dependent on initial endowment of rights and alternative water trade action, manifested here as persistence-informed trade and no trade alternative. While variable, investment outcomes for probabilistic hydrologic simulations reveal long-term trade stability under nearly every forecast-informed water trading simulation, suggesting options contracts may be viable under a variety of water scarcity conditions. A key insight is that seasonal climate forecasts may prove to be quite valuable when translated through sectoral models, providing the tailored information to end users with diverse risk attitudes. This reinforces the potential in including forecasts in agricultural water resources decision support frameworks, as a hedge against water scarcity for farmers of varied earning potential. © 2020","Agent based; Forecast; Option contracts; Risk attitude; Scarcity; Water markets; Water rights; Water trade","Climate models; Commerce; Crops; Decision making; Decision support systems; Electronic trading; Forecasting; International law; Water resources; Wooden fences; Agent based; Option contracts; Risk attitude; Scarcity; Water market; Water rights; Water trades; Reservoirs (water); attitudinal survey; basin management; cooperative sector; decision making; forecasting method; public attitude; resource allocation; resource scarcity; risk assessment; semiarid region; simulation; trade-environment relations; uncertainty analysis; water economics; water flow; willingness to pay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078837669

The empirical application uses primary data collected by the authority in charge of the monitoring and repression of fraud in food value chains between the years 2007 and 2015. This is a unique dataset to analyze the issue, although it includes only data on food fraud within the country. The results of the SAM simulations show that the share of economy directly and indirectly linked to the supply of irregular food products accounts for 0.5% of the total value of output and is able to activate up to 156 thousand labor units. The net impact of food fraud on output and employment in the whole economy is negative, with losses averaging up to 1.8 billion euros of output and of 20,000 jobs per year, with a relative impact significantly larger in agriculture than in the food industry. These figures reveal an intrinsic fragility of the agri-food system, especially in those subsectors featuring relatively large price elasticities such as quality products (e.g., wine, olive oil, cheese). The overall conclusion is that food fraud is not only a source of unfair competition to regular production activities but also has an overall contractionary impact on the whole economy due to its directly unproductive rent-seeking nature.

But generally speaking, SD goals and targets are continuously evolving, country specific, complex to implement, and are often given relatively short time horizons, such as the 15-year horizon for the SDGs. Many SD issues need a much longer time horizon as the policy interventions to deal with these issues can take decades before their effects become apparent, which is especially true for China. The T21 China 2050 is developed to study the long-term SD challenges and opportunities of the country. In its business-as-usual simulation to 2050, T21 China 2050 reveals some of the sustainability challenges facing China, including 1) aging population and labor force decline, 2) huge food imports, 3) land degradation and loss of arable land, 4) water shortages, 5) huge fossil fuel imports, and 6) carbon dioxide emissions. These SD issues are a subset of the SDGs specifically relevant to China over a time horizon well beyond 2030. The model is then used to test possible policy interventions in these six areas under two separate scenarios: Balanced and Narrowly Focused. The major results from these two scenarios are compared with those of the business-as-usual scenario. The simulations show that by adopting certain policy measures, China's path towards SD can be further improved. It also shows that a variety of policy measures can be selected and tested with the T21 China 2050 model for exploring the future SD prospects of the country. Specific policies recommended include: extension of retirement age, adjustment of the current family planning policy, protection of agriculture land, promotion of agricultural R&D to raise yield, improvement of public transportation to slow private vehicle ownership, increased investment in renewable energy, and water conservation. © 2020","Scenario comparison; SDGs; Sustainable development planning","environmental planning; environmental policy; policy approach; scenario analysis; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal; United Nations; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097456185

In this article, I propose to focus on the career of the impact foresight model to analyse how agro-economists combine imaginaries, narratives, data and calculative technologies addressing the long-term future of agriculture. Impact is a partial equilibrium model, which has become increasingly comprehensive. Its modular structure now enables it to interweave scenarios produced by other legitimate institutions, and to run simulations for a number of configurations of climate change and socio-economic evolutions. In this article, foresight models are taken to be material discursive devices. My argument is that their evolutions as technologies and the framing of the future they operate should not be analysed separately. Transforming radical uncertainty into controlled variability – magnitude of change, they explicitly endeavour to ‘bound’ uncertainty. But it is ‘bounded’ in a way that is highly dependent on the knowledge infrastructure upon which the models rely. Quantified modelling also makes it possible for economists to compare rival models and create alignments or negotiate zones of consensus, that is, a certain form of knowledge on the future. In the case under scrutiny, technological choices and data processing work contribute to reinforce a certain point of view – market, production and technology-oriented – on food security. Studying infrastructure and model design therefore allows a better understanding of path dependency and cognitive lock-in effects regarding the way the future is envisaged and narrated. © 2020 SAGE Publications.","agriculture; economics; Food security; foresight; future; scenarios","agricultural economics; cognition; food security; future prospect; knowledge; numerical model; scenario analysis; socioeconomic impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081394156

This study aimed (i) to perform a cradle-to-gate CFP of pasture-based beef cattle in a Mediterranean agropastoral system (ii) and to assess the effects on the CFP of alternative tillage, fertilizing, and grazing practices under current (NCC) and future climate change (CC) scenarios. Minimum (Mt) and no-tillage (Nt) practices were compared to current tillage (Ct); a 50% increase (Hf) and decrease (Lf) in fertilization was evaluated against the current (Cf) rate; and rotational grazing (Rg) was evaluated versus the current continuous grazing (Cg) system. The denitrification–decomposition (DNDC) model was run using NCC as well as representative concentration pathways to investigate the effects of farm management practices coupled with future CC scenarios on SOC dynamics, N2O fluxes, and crop yield. Within NCC and CtCf, an emission intensity of 26.9 ± 0.7 kg CO2eq per kg live body weight was estimated. Compared to Ct, the adoption of Mt and Nt reduced the CFP by 20% and 35%, respectively, while NtHf reduced it by 40%.

The production of these raw materials contribute significantly to the total environmental life cycle impacts of these bio-based products. No study has yet assessed and compared the non-cellulosic FC sources in the USA. Methods: To this aim, the environmental life cycle assessment method was used to compare FC derived from conventional agricultural feedstocks. The study compared four agricultural feedstocks from the USA and one additional feedstock that was used as a reference. The feedstocks from the USA were energycane (a.k.a energy cane), sweet sorghum, maize (a.k.a., corn), and sugar beet. This study used Brazilian sugarcane (BSC) as a reference of low environmental impacts. The environmental impacts assessed were greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, fossil fuel use, and eutrophication potential. The environmental assessment included a Monte Carlo simulation to assess the uncertainty of the results. A sensitivity analysis was also executed by using the method of changing one variable at a time to identify the most influential input variables. Results and discussion: The assessment showed that FC from energycane has low overall environmental impacts relative to the other US feedstocks evaluated and it resulted in environmental effects similar to those of the BSC. This life cycle assessment shows that US sugar beet has a different impact profile compared to the other feedstocks evaluated; having low eutrophication impact and high in both GHG emissions and fossil fuel use impacts. FC from sweet sorghum has low GHG emissions and fossil fuel use relative to maize (also known as corn) and sugar beet; however, the uncertainty associated with these impacts is greater than that of energycane, sugarcane, and maize. Conclusions: The assessment shows there are fermentable carbohydrates sources in the USA with lower environmental impacts than the maize feedstock, currently dominant in the USA, and the impacts of the best performing of these are comparable to BSC. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biofuels; Energy; Eutrophication impact; Fermentable carbohydrates; Greenhouse gasses; Life cycle assessment; Renewable chemicals","biofuel; carbohydrate; chemical compound; fermentable carbohydrate; fossil fuel; renewable chemical; unclassified drug; agriculture; Article; biofuel production; carbon footprint; controlled study; environmental impact; eutrophication; life cycle assessment; maize; Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; priority journal; renewable resource; sorghum; sugar beet; sugarcane; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075336240

Here, we examine such benefits in a realistic landscape (Brittany, France), with diversely fragmented farm territories and locally validated field-based ecological functions (the abundance of a generalist pest-predatory insect). We test whether such properties modulate the previous results by simulating several management strategies of biological control with an agronomic-ecological-economic landscape model. We find that, if landscape-scale management improves the collective benefits, some farmers lose by collaborating. Due to the heterogeneity of farms, the stability of the collective action is rarely satisfied at the landscape scale: the probability that the collective management of productive ecosystem services occurs is 15% in our case. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; APILand; Biological control; Coordination; Heterogeneous agents; Land use; Simulation","biological control; collective action; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; land use; simulation; territory; Bretagne; France; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075198306

The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon, highly related to the rapid urbanization, has attracted considerable attention from both academic scholars and governmental policymakers because of its direct influence on citizens' daily life. Land surface temperature (LST) is a widely used indicator to assess the intensity of UHI significantly affected by the local land use/cover (LULC). In this study, we used the Landsat time-series data to derive the LULC composition and LST distribution maps of Nanjing in 2000, 2014, and 2018. A correlation analysis was carried out to check the relationship between LST and the density of each class of LULC. We found out that cropland and forest in Nanjing are helping to cool the city with different degrees of cooling effects depending on the location and LULC composition. Then, a Cellar Automata (CA)-Markov model was applied to predict the LULC conditions of Nanjing in 2030 and 2050. Based on the simulated LULC maps and the relationship between LST and LULC, we delineated high-and moderate-LST related risk areas in the city of Nanjing. Our findings are valuable for the local government to reorganize the future development zones in a way to control the urban climate environment and to keep a healthy social life within the city. © 2020 by the authors.","Cellar Automata-Markov model; Future simulation; Land surface temperature; Nanjing; Urban heat island; Urban land use/cover","Atmospheric temperature; Automata theory; Forestry; Land use; Landforms; Markov processes; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Future simulation; Markov model; Nanjing; Urban heat island; Urban land use; Land surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080891839

Several machine learning approaches were used in this study to investigate the relative influences of multiple biophysical, socio-economic, and crop management features in determining maize yield variability using several machine learning approaches. Soil fertility status was assessed in 180 farms and paired with the surveyed data on maize yield, socio-economic conditions, and agronomic management. The C&RT relative variable importance plot identified farm size, total labor, soil factors, seed rate, fertilizer, and organic manure as influential factors. Among the three approaches compared for classifying maize yield, the artificial neural network (ANN) yielded the least (25%) misclassification on validation samples. The random forest partial dependence plots revealed a positive association between farm size and maize productivity. Nonlinear support vector machine boundary analysis for the eight top important variables revealed complex interactions underpinning maize yield response. Notably, farm size and total labor synergistically increased maize yield. Future research integrating these algorithms with empirical crop growth models and crop simulation models for ex-ante yield estimations could result in further improvement. © 2020 Dutta et al.

Agricultural expansion causes forest degradation in SSA through livestock grazing, reducing forest carbon (C) sinks and increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, intensification should produce more food while reducing pressure on forests. This study assessed the potential for the dairy sector in Kenya to contribute to low-emissions development by exploring three feeding scenarios. The analyses used empirical spatially explicit data, and a simulation model to quantify milk production, agricultural emissions and forest C loss due to grazing. The scenarios explored improvements in forage quality (Fo), feed conservation (Fe) and concentrate supplementation (Co): FoCo fed high-quality Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum), FeCo supplemented maize silage and FoFeCo a combination of Napier, silage and concentrates. Land shortages and forest C loss due to grazing were quantified with land requirements and feed availability around forests. All scenarios increased milk yields by 44%–51%, FoCo reduced GHG emission intensity from 2.4 ± 0.1 to 1.6 ± 0.1 kg CO2eq per kg milk, FeCo reduced it to 2.2 ± 0.1, whereas FoFeCo increased it to 2.7 ± 0.2 kg CO2eq per kg milk because of land use change emissions. Closing the yield gap of maize by increasing N fertilizer use reduced emission intensities by 17% due to reduced emissions from conversion of grazing land. FoCo was the only scenario that mitigated agricultural and forest emissions by reducing emission intensity by 33% and overall emissions by 2.5% showing that intensification of dairy in a low-income country can increase milk yields without increasing emissions. There are, however, risks of C leakage if agricultural and forest policies are not aligned leading to loss of forest to produce concentrates. This approach will aid the assessment of the climate-smartness of livestock production practices at the national level in East Africa. © 2019 The Authors.

The methodology consists of a comparative cost-benefit analysis based on the Value of Information approach that makes it possible to analyse whether an improvement in the information available to farmers generates economic benefits. The method is applied to the problem of comparing computer irrigation models (providing irrigation advice based on measurements, water balance models and weather predictions) and prevailing irrigation practices (at times based on soil and plant observations, or on advanced technologies) in estimating and predicting crop water requirements, in pilot experiments located in four different European regions. The results reveal that the introduction of the alternative method improves the performance of irrigation practices in Mediterranean regions that are characterised by high weather variability and for those crops for which the consequences of failing to meet predictions are relatively low (i.e. tomato instead of maize, drip irrigated crops instead of sprinkler irrigated crops). Under favourable conditions, the use of the alternative technology generates a 0–20% increase in gross margin and a 10–30% water saving with respect to prevailing existing irrigation practices. The study concludes by addressing the conditions that justify the use of advanced information systems to schedule irrigation interventions and by offering some policy recommendations to drive their uptake. These include subsidising research at the evaluation stage and public investments aimed at knowledge creation (weather and shallow water table monitoring stations) and knowledge sharing (counselling) at the adoption stage. © 2019","Irrigation scheduling; Uncertainty; Value of information","Cost benefit analysis; Crops; Economics; Forecasting; Groundwater; Information management; Information use; Investments; Sprinkler systems (irrigation); Water conservation; Advanced Information Systems; Alternative technologies; Comparative advantage; Crop water requirements; Irrigation scheduling; Policy recommendations; Uncertainty; Value of information; Water management; computer simulation; cost-benefit analysis; information management; irrigation system; uncertainty analysis; water budget; water economics; water management; water table; water use efficiency; Lycopersicon esculentum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073447218

Overall, our findings suggest that past dismal growth performance and poverty trends in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are due to sub-optimal investment in agricultural sector. Our results suggest that optimal level of agricultural investment paves the way to achieving both growth and poverty goals faster than it would have been possible otherwise. Over the period 2002-2012, agricultural investment represents only 45% of its optimal levels. Under the optimal investment scenario, agricultural GDP grows faster. However, agricultural GDP growth rate falls significantly behind that of non-agricultural GDP, and thus delay the achievement of growth and poverty goals. Simulation results suggest that additional agricultural investment coupled with improved agricultural inputs productivity will speed up the country’s pace toward achieving growth and poverty reduction targets: a 10% increase in labour productivity combined with a 10% increase in land productivity reduces by 18 years the amount of time within which the CAADP growth goal will be reached and increases the pace of poverty reduction. © 2019, © 2019 International Food Policy Institute.","agriculture; CAADP; Economic growth; optimal investment; poverty reduction","algorithm; alternative agriculture; economic growth; growth modeling; industrial investment; poverty alleviation; Democratic Republic Congo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068089508

Thus, the level of discombobulation among people, companies, or countries is indeed unprecedented. The fact that industry 4.0 is explosively disrupting or retrofitting each and every industrial sector makes industry 4.0 the famous buzzword amongst researchers today. However, the insight of industry 4.0 disruption into the industrial sectors remains ill-defined in both academic and nonacademic literature. The present study aimed at identifying industry 4.0 neologisms, understanding the industry 4.0 disruption and illustrating the disruptive technology convergence in the major industrial sectors. A total of 99 neologisms of industry 4.0 were identified. Industry 4.0 disruption in the education industry (education 4.0), energy industry (energy 4.0), agriculture industry (agriculture 4.0), healthcare industry (healthcare 4.0), and logistics industry (logistics 4.0) was described.

SD was used since it is able to accommodate internal and external factors that influence the value of the rice supply chain. The simulation results showed that increasing the value of the rice supply chain can be achieved by increasing the quantity and quality of the crop yield and implementing the BioIndustry programme, farmer empowerment, and information sharing. This strategy is projected to increase rice productivity with an average of 1.4% per year. Increasing farmer profit can be achieved by empowering the farmers through the development of farmer groups and information sharing to cut the rice supply chain. Farmer's profit can also be increased by implementing the BioIndustry programme. By selling rice directly and implementing the BioIndustry programme, the total farmer profit will increase by 7.6% per year. © Operational Research Society 2020.","efficiency; Model; rice supply chain; simulation; system dynamics","Computer software; Information analysis; Information dissemination; Profitability; Supply chains; Bio-industry; Crop yield; Indonesia; Information sharing; Internal and external factors; Simulation model; System Dynamics; Agriculture",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094194093

However, these devices consume a considerable amount of energy to perform their operations that has a significant impact on the environment, product cost and life of the device. Given this fact, energy-efficient solutions for smart environments have gained great attention from researchers and the industrial community. In this context, a novel fog-based multi-level energy-efficient framework for IoT-enabled smart environments has been proposed. To achieve this, the proposed framework adds additional two layers in the existing IoT-fog-cloud architecture - sensors-based energy-efficient hardware layer and policy layer, to monitor the energy consumption and to enable the energy-aware decision making. Initially, the main sources of energy consumption in an IoT-enabled smart environment are identified. Further, the energy requirements of a device to perform a specific task are estimated. Moreover, the alternative devices to perform the same task using less energy are searched out. Finally, a device or a set of devices, to process the job consuming lower energy while ensuring the job requirements, is selected. To validate the proposed framework, four case studies are considered - smart parking, smart hospital specifically ICU, smart agriculture and smart airport. Simulations are conducted using iFogsim toolkit and results show that a significant amount of energy can be conserved by employing the proposed framework. © 2013 IEEE.","cloud; energy constraint devices; Energy efficiency; fog; IoT; smart environment","Agricultural robots; Decision making; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Fog; Green computing; Intensive care units; Internet of things; Power management; Smartphones; Cloud architectures; Energy requirements; Impact on the environment; Industrial communities; Internet of thing (IOT); Networking equipment; Smart agricultures; Smart environment; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090284097

Managing future risk requires an understanding of the interactions between fecal sources, hydroclimatic conditions, and best management practices (BMPs) at spatial scales relevant to decision makers. In this study, we used the Hydrologic Simulation Program FORTRAN (HSPF) to quantify potential fecal coliform (FC, an indicator of the potential presence of pathogens) responses to a range of mid-century climate scenarios and assess different BMP scenarios (based on reduction factors) for reducing the risk of water quality impairment in two small agricultural watersheds: the Chippewa watershed in Minnesota, and the Tye watershed in Virginia. In each watershed, simulations show a wide range of FC responses, driven largely by variability in projected future precipitation. Wetter future conditions, which drive more transport from nonpoint sources (e.g., manure application, livestock grazing), show increases in FC loads. Loads typically decrease in drier futures; however, higher mean FC concentrations and more recreational water quality criteria exceedances occur, likely caused by reduced flow during low-flow periods. Median changes across the ensemble generally show increases in FC load. BMPs that focus on key fecal sources (e.g., runoff from pasture, livestock defecation in streams) within a watershed can mitigate the effects of hydroclimatic change on FC loads. However, more extensive BMP implementation or improved BMP efficiency (i.e., higher FC reductions) may be needed to fully offset increases in FC load and meet water quality goals, such as total maximum daily loads and recreational water quality standards. Strategies for managing climate risk should be flexible and to the extent possible include resilient BMPs that function as designed under a range of future conditions. © 2020 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

The plantation manager is in charge of synchronizing resources (i.e., crews and a complex cableway network) to harvest at the right time to maximize palm oil yield in latter stages of the value chain. In particular, in this type of crop it is ideal to visit each palm every eight to twelve days to avoid loose fruit picking, over-ripeness, or rotten fruit harvesting. To optimize harvest operations, we propose an end-to-end analytics solution involving data treatment, descriptive (simulation), and prescriptive models (optimization) in this agricultural system. At the core of our approach lies a set of interconnected models that use optimization, heuristic techniques, and simulation. These models cover strategic (harvest cycle), tactical (resource allocation), and operational (transport allocation) decisions. We present a case study of a 2000-ha plantation located in the Colombian Orinoquia.

AV use is expected to reduce crash, transport costs, and land use. However, the net effects of the autonomous vehicle are unknown because there are no fully-autonomous vehicles in reality. The simulation systems are indispensable to be built up not only for cost but also for obtaining massive data. An agent-based simulation is capable of simulating the entities in a complex system, such as the AV system. Considering the potential of agent-based models to complement existing models and the difficulty to understand, to duplicate and to compare different agent-based models, this paper review existing agent-based modeling of autonomous vehicles with the help of ODD protocol, which has been applied in the review of agent-based land-use change models and agricultural policy evaluation. The significant variables that researchers have taken into consideration in sensitivity analysis and in the different scenarios are explored in the paper. Fleet size is the primary variable researchers considered, and we also discussed the probable causes of different AV replacement rates. We have assessed the quality of reviewed articles to gain more acceptance from the agent-based modeling community. Most of the reviewed papers follow the ODD protocol of agent decision making. However, in order to improve the level of modeling transparency, the executable and related data shall be available, at least the data source and the programming language/simulation platform should be provided.

Previous studies discussed that the irrigation signal might depend on the geographical region as well as the synoptic and climatic conditions. The work presented here aims to investigate the mechanisms behind changes in the irrigation impact on the local conditions depending on synoptic changes. Different to previous works, this employs convection-permitting simulations. Irrigation processes are parameterized in three different ways depending on the evaporative loss. The region of focus is in northern Italy (Po Valley), which is of interest for both the soil-atmosphere coupling strength and widely used irrigation. The simulation period is Summer 2015 (May-July), which includes a heatwave month (July) and an average month (June). The results show how irrigation prevented the drying out of the soil layers during the heatwave. This influences the surface flux partition differently, by increasing moisture flux and decreasing the sensible heat flux. In general, the irrigation impact magnitude, with respect to the control simulation, is more than double in July compared to June. This study discusses climate implications for the region, such as the impact of widespread irrigation on the vegetation health, the heatwave feedback mechanism, atmospheric pollution, and human heat discomfort. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate impact; Irrigation; Regional high-resolution model","Agricultural robots; Climate models; Heat flux; Soils; Atmospheric pollution; Climatic conditions; Control simulation; Coupling strengths; Feedback mechanisms; High-resolution models; Regional climate; Sensible heat flux; Irrigation; climate effect; irrigation system; modeling; moisture flux; regional climate; sensible heat flux; Italy; Po Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083973819

Pathogens like Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus, can quickly spread among producers. Biosecurity is designed to prevent infection transmission. When considering biosecurity investments, management must balance the cost of protection versus the consequences of contracting an infection. Thus, an examination of the decision making processes associated with investment in biosecurity is important for enhancing system wide biosecurity. Data gathered from experimental gaming simulations can provide insights into behavioral strategies and inform the development of decision support systems. We created an online digital experiment to simulate outbreak scenarios among swine production supply chains, where participants were tasked with making biosecurity investment decisions. In Experiment One, we quantified the risk associated with each participant's decisions and delineated three dominant categories of risk attitudes: risk averse, risk tolerant, and opportunistic. Each risk class exhibited unique approaches in reaction to risk and disease information. We also tested how information uncertainty affects risk aversion, by varying the amount of visibility of the infection as well as the amount of biosecurity implemented across the system. We found evidence that more visibility in the number of infected sites increases risk averse behaviors, while more visibility in the amount of neighboring biosecurity increased risk taking behaviors. In Experiment Two, we were surprised to find no evidence for differences in behavior of livestock specialists compared to Amazon Mechanical Turk participants. Our findings provide support for using experimental gaming simulations to study how risk communication affects behavior, which can provide insights towards more effective messaging strategies.

We use an example inspired by the Florida production system of high-value, labor-intensive fruits. We find that crop diversification to high-value crops is a robust strategy when labor shocks are mild, and that crop diversification becomes less valuable as more simulated farms practice it.

We formed scenarios for future technological progress, demand growth, and biofuel policy and carried out a dynamic simulation. The major findings are: (1) Increasing technological progress reduces cropland for biofuel and cropland pasture for livestock but increases cropland for crop production; (2) Reducing corn ethanol requirements causes more cropland to move from cropping to pasture uses for livestock, however, lowering ethanol from corn residue has minor effects on cropland use; (3) Lowering the requirement of ethanol from corn lowers the price for most of the field crops and meat commodities, especially corn, hay, sorghum, and non-fed beef; (4) Technological progress and biofuel policy have significant effects of on GHG emissions. Increasing technical progress reduces overall GHG emissions. A lower corn ethanol level results in much larger GHG emissions as compared with the control case. This implies producing corn ethanol is effective in reducing emissions; and (5) Technological improvement is a key factor in meeting growing global demand for food and energy and reducing emissions. © 2019 by the authors.","Agriculture; Bioenergy; Climate change; Energy policy; Land use; Technological progress","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Biofuels; Climate change; Commerce; Crops; Cultivation; Emission control; Ethanol; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Bio-energy; Biofuel policies; Crop production; Reducing emissions; Resource usage; Technical progress; Technological improvements; Technological progress; Energy policy; agricultural market; agricultural technology; bioenergy; climate change; crop production; energy policy; land use; livestock; technological development; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079690884

For the structural changes and economy-wide impacts, including behavioural changes of rural land distribution, to be assessed and captured through time, a South African Social Accounting Matrix can be used as a database to construct a dynamic computable general equilibrium simulation model to simulate the potential impact on household welfare in South Africa. This study seeks to assess how government redistributive policies may affect household welfare in short-and long-run, focusing on poverty and income distribution in South Africa by applying a dynamic computable general equilibrium microsimulation model. The results showed that rural land distribution increases poor household income through an increase in factor by an average of 0.828. However, for most macroeconomic variables, the impact is negative in the short-run with a gradual increase in the long-run.

Nevertheless, small reservoirs promote water spatial distribution and play a major role for livelihood in rural areas. To fill the gap of operation methods for non-strategic reservoirs used for irrigation where water is a limiting factor, the NeStRes model was developed. The model is composed of three modules: i) hydrological: to define the reliability of water withdrawals from the reservoir; ii) agricultural: to simulate crop production based on water availability; iii) economic: to compute the possible income from irrigated agricultural crops. NeStRes was applied to 91 reservoirs of the semiarid Banabuiú River Basin – BRB, Brazil. The simulations indicated that the maximum income from the cultivation of maize is obtained when the reservoirs are intensely used, drying completely in one to two thirds of the time. Adoption of a fixed reliability level of daily water supply (54%, in the BRB) generates at least 85% of the maximum possible income for all simulated reservoirs. This model application suggests a paradigm change in the operation of small non-strategic reservoirs in drylands: to use water for crop production and save the revenue, instead of saving water, which is susceptible to evaporation. Although high reliability level is desired for human supply by strategic reservoirs, non-strategic ones can be more intensely explored to generate income from irrigated agriculture in drylands. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Drylands; Irrigation; Reservoir operation; Water scarcity","Crops; Cultivation; Irrigation; Reliability; Water management; Water supply; Agricultural crops; Dry land; Irrigated agriculture; Model application; Operation methods; Reservoir operation; Water availability; Water scarcity; Reservoirs (water); crop production; dryland farming; irrigation; modeling; reservoir; semiarid region; water availability; Banabuiu River; Brazil; Ceara; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076921726

In China, agricultural sources contribute to the majority of ammonia emissions. It is necessary and valuable to explore air quality improvements caused by the mitigation of agricultural ammonia emissions. The purpose of this study was to quantify the reduction effects on PM2.5 and secondary inorganic aerosols by performing air quality simulations based on the developed agricultural ammonia emission inventory at the county-level within the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. The results demonstrated that the total NH3 emission in the BTH region was 1625.03 Gg in 2015. Livestock manure spreading represented 58% of the total emissions (941.79 Gg NH3), while synthetic fertilizer applications accounted for the remaining 42% of the emissions. Spatially, the agricultural ammonia emissions were generally distributed over the southern BTH regions (Handan and Shijiazhuang) due to the intensive agricultural activities in this area. Temporally, the agricultural ammonia emissions peaked during summer, consistent with variations in temperature and agricultural practices. Compared to the baseline scenario, the annual average PM2.5 concentrations in the BTH region were reduced by 2.57%, 5.08%, and 5.71%, respectively, under the Progressive (NH3 emission cut by 21.26%), Stringent (NH3 emission cut by 45.58%), and Complex (NH3 emission cut by 46.63%) scenarios. Moreover, under the same conditions, secondary inorganic aerosols such as sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium were alleviated by 2.94–6.85%, 3.45–17.9%, and 4.24–23.32%, respectively. The results confirmed that mitigating ammonia emissions could lead to the considerable reduction of nitrate, followed by ammonium. In contrast, the impact on sulfate was relatively limited. This study could provide helpful and reliable evidence to determine effective mitigation measures and control strategies for policy makers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural ammonia emission; PM2.5; Reduction effect; Secondary inorganic aerosols; WRF-CMAQ","Aerosols; Agriculture; Air pollution control; Air quality; Fertilizers; Nitrates; Sulfur compounds; Ammonia emissions; PM2.5; Reduction effects; Secondary inorganic aerosol; WRF-CMAQ; Ammonia; ammonia; nitrate; nitrogen fertilizer; sulfate; aerosol composition; air quality; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; fertilizer application; inorganic compound; manure; particulate matter; pollution control; sulfate; aerosol; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; environmental temperature; fertilizer application; livestock; manure; nonhuman; particulate matter; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); simulation; summer; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073102375

The SHP is one of the more productive areas of the country and covers a large landmass, including parts of Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. This region faces challenges in sustainable crop production due to declining water levels in the Ogallala Aquifer, the primary source of water for irrigated crop production. This study examines the impact of integrating cover crops in the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L)-based rotations on farm profitability and risk in the SHP. The study combines experimental yield data with other secondary information, including market prices, to conduct simulation analysis and evaluate the risk involved in introducing cover crops in a wheat-fallow cropping system. The results show that, due to the additional monetary costs involved, none of the cover crop options is economically viable. However, when secondary benefits (erosion control and green nitrogen) or government subsidies are included in the analysis, one of the cover crop options (peas) dominates the fallow alternative. Moreover, when the secondary benefits and a government subsidy are combined, two cover crop alternatives (peas and oats) emerge as more profitable options than leaving land fallow. These results highlight the importance of agricultural research and extension programs that are making a concerted effort to develop more productive farming techniques and increase public awareness about the long-term benefits of adopting soil health management systems such as cover cropping in the SHP region. © 2019 by the authors.","Nitrogen fixation; Profitability soil erosion; Risk; Subsidy; Sustainability","agricultural production; alternative agriculture; cover crop; crop production; crop rotation; crop yield; environmental quality; farming system; profitability; soil quality; water level; wheat; Great Plains; New Mexico; Ogallala Aquifer; Texas; United States; Avena; Pisum sativum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083852830

We investigate the effects of IST on income variability and levels as well as on income inequality in the farming population. We take Italian agriculture as an example as the introduction of IST is currently under discussion there. A rich panel of 2777 farms was studied over a period of 7 years. We use stochastic simulation to derive different income inequality estimates and apply Gini decomposition approaches to assess the distributional implications of IST. We compare the current income situation with that resulting from a hypothetical implementation of IST under different policy scenarios, also accounting for reduced levels of CAP direct payments. We find that IST not only stabilizes farm income but also enhances its level and reduces income inequality in Italian agriculture. IST is more effective in reducing income inequality when farmers pay contributions to mutual funds that are proportional to their income compared to the case of flat rate contributions. Finally, results do not support the hypothesis that the impact of IST will differ if the level of direct payments were to be reduced. Thus, results seem robust enough to accommodate future policy conditions. © 2019, The Author(s).","Agricultural policy; Direct payments; Income inequality; Income Stabilization Tool; Risk management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076885507

However, the reliability of public water supplies can also be influenced by the quality of water bodies. In this study, we proposed a framework that integrates the analysis of risks of inadequate water quality and risks of insufficient water availability. We have developed a coupled modeling system that combines hydrological modeling of river water quantity and quality, rules for water withdrawals from rivers into storage reservoirs, and dynamical simulation of harmful algal blooms in storage reservoirs. We use this framework to assess the impact of climate change, demand growth, and land-use change on the reliability of public water supplies. The proposed method is tested on the River Thames catchment in the south of England. The results show that alongside the well-known risks of rising water demand in the south of England and uncertain impacts of climate change, diffuse pollution from agriculture and effluent from upstream waste water treatment works potentially represent a threat to the reliability of public water supplies in London. We quantify the steps that could be taken to ameliorate these threats, though even a vigorous pollution-prevention strategy would not be sufficient to offset the projected effects of climate change on water quality and the reliability of public water supplies. The proposed method can help water utilities to recognize their system vulnerability and evaluate the potential solutions to achieve more reliable water supplies. ©2019.

This conflict, considering the income of different sectors and environmental issues, is very crucial, especially in reservoir operation. In this study, a multi-objective optimization algorithm combined with two simulation models (SWAT and WEAP) has been developed to consider the tradeoff between agricultural benefit and environmental water demand through parallel processing. In this model, decision variables are monthly agricultural demands which are considered as inputs into the Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) model. Then, the production of different crops and discharge to the downstream lake are obtained based on the allocated water to each sector using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. After the simulation, the objective functions are calculated based on agricultural income and environmental flow discharged to the downstream lake. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, Mahabad reservoir, in Mahabad river basin (located at the south of the Lake Urmia and northwestern of Iran), was studied during a drought period. This reservoir supplies domestic, industry, agriculture water of the Mahabad plain and downstream environmental demand which is discharged to the Lake Urmia. Non-dominated Sorting Differential Evolution (NSDE) algorithm is used to find the optimal water allocation to different sectors and efficient agricultural irrigation patterns of different crops (winter wheat, alfalfa, apple, and sugar beet). Results showed the optimal operation of the reservoir through irrigation management could improve water stress indicator from 80% in traditional irrigation pattern to 60%, only by 6.5% decrease in agricultural income.

The intense manipulation of the hydrological regime has led to the depletion of the water resources in the state and the subsequent use of various adaptive management strategies to cope with environmental conditions and social concerns. The historical imbalance between water pumping and replenishment in Pajaro Valley has led to overdrafted aquifers, seawater intrusion, and salinization. The objective of this study is to estimate the sustainable carrying capacity of agricultural land in Pajaro Valley while preventing groundwater overdraft. A groundwater box model was built and calibrated using historical data to represent current and future hydrology and water management strategies. An optimization model maximized the economic profit using the agricultural acreage as the decision variable with a set of constraints aimed at determining the sustainable carrying capacity of the groundwater basin. Model constraints include total land and water availability, crop acreage, agricultural water use, and historical demand. In the Pajaro Valley, agricultural operations must use less water more efficiently, which means changes in crop types, size of activities, and fallowing land in parts of the basin. Results of the optimal scenario over 25 years show a 15% reduction of total agricultural acreage, 8.5% reduction in food production, average profit loss of 4%, and a 79% reduction in aquifer depletion. This study provides an overall vision of what can be accomplished with coordinated land use planning using strategies that harmonize individual decisions and shared natural resources. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Agriculture; Aquifer storage; Groundwater; Simulation-optimization model; Sustainability; Water management","Agriculture; Aquifers; Climate change; Crops; Digital storage; Groundwater; Hydrogeology; Land use; Landforms; Optimization; Population statistics; Profitability; Sustainable development; Water management; Agricultural industrializations; Agricultural operations; Aquifer storage; Environmental conditions; Simulation-optimization models; Sustainable agricultural; Water management strategies; Water resources availability; Groundwater resources; agricultural land; alternative agriculture; aquifer; carrying capacity; groundwater; hydrological modeling; land use planning; optimization; sustainability; water management; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072643582

Assessment of the systemic effects of the circular economy on a global scale from a holistic perspective is the need of the hour. This work addresses this challenge and models the circular economy in a planetary model with integrated human, ecological and industrial components. The circular economy is modelled as an industry which processes the used industrial goods. These are used along with the goods produced using virgin raw materials. Different time delays and circulation rates parameterize 90 different routes of implementation of the circular economy. These are implemented for nine levels of resource consumption increase by humans complemented by population growth. System collapse due to the scarcity of ecosystem-based resources occurs sooner as the consumption level increases. Model simulation results indicate substantial benefits of adopting the circular economy. Incorporation of circular economy delays the system collapse by at least a few decades and aggressive implementation of the circular economy, in several cases, avoided this collapse entirely. Based on these results, the time horizon of the next 70–90 years is identified as critical, before which a large scale implementation of the circular economy is essential. However, very aggressive implementation of circular economy leads to system collapse because of the depletion of common access ecosystem services caused by continued high consumption. Thus, this work establishes benefits of the circular economy and recommends a balanced approach for the adoption of the circular economy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Circular economy; Integrated model; Policy; Unsustainable resource consumption","Agriculture; Ecosystems; Population statistics; Public policy; Circular economy; Consumption levels; Ecosystem services; Global sustainability; Holistic perspectives; Industrial components; Integrated modeling; Resource consumption; Industrial economics; adaptive management; ecosystem service; environmental economics; holistic approach; policy approach; resource scarcity; resource use; sustainability; agriculture; Article; circular economy; compartment model; computer simulation; economic aspect; ecosystem; environmental sustainability; human; population growth; recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071971625

To spatial-temporally analyze the trade-off between yield and GHG emissions under different N fertilization levels at regional scale, this study integrated geographic information system (GIS) and the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC, Version 9.5) model to define the impacts of different N fertilization levels on rice production, SOC sequestration, and GHG emission in Fuyang District, a county-scale region in Eastern China. The whole region was divided into 28825 polygon-based modeling units based on heterogeneity of soil property, climate and agricultural management conditions. After validating the DNDC model by field observation data of the year 1979 and 2015, five N fertilization levels (0, 140, 210, 280 and 350 kg N ha−1) from the year 2016–2035 were designed for simulating the rice yield, SOC sequestration, N2O and methane (CH4) emissions. Validation results showed a good performance of the refined DNDC model. Simulation results indicated that yield and GHG emission increased with the growth of N fertilization rate, but the SOC sequestration change was not noticeable. Around 210 kg N ha−1 was recommended as optimal N fertilization level in Fuyang District, because its global warming potential intensity (GWPI) was the lowest among all the N fertilization levels. As excessive N input is a common problem across China, our results provide a case for a win-win scenario for both food security and environmental friendliness. © 2019","Agricultural GHG emissions; DNDC model; GIS; Nitrogen fertilization; Rice yield; Trade-off","Agriculture; Economic and social effects; Food supply; Geographic information systems; Global warming; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; DNDC models; GHG emission; Nitrogen fertilization; Rice yield; Trade off; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070892515

We show that protein conserving plant alternatives to meat that rigorously satisfy key nutritional constraints while minimizing cropland, nitrogen fertilizer (Nr) and water use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions exist, and could improve public health. We develop a new methodology for identifying nutritional constraints whose satisfaction by plant eaters is challenging, disproportionately shaping the optimal diets, singling out energy, mass, monounsaturated fatty acids, vitamins B3,12 and D, choline, zinc, and selenium. By replacing meat with the devised plant alternatives—dominated by soy, green pepper, squash, buckwheat, and asparagus—Americans can collectively eliminate pastureland use while saving 35–50% of their diet related needs for cropland, Nr, and GHG emission, but increase their diet related irrigation needs by 15%. While widely replacing meat with plants is logistically and culturally challenging, few competing options offer comparable multidimensional resource use reduction. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"agriculture; animal; computer simulation; energy conservation; human; meat; Monte Carlo method; nutrition policy; procedures; United States; vegetarian diet; Agriculture; Animals; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Energy Resources; Diet, Vegetarian; Humans; Meat; Monte Carlo Method; Nutrition Policy; Plant Proteins, Dietary; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070351536

Moving from the agricultural soils through the subsurface and reemerging to the surface water, N undergoes various biogeochemical reactions along pathways in the subsurface, which occur heterogeneously in space and time. Thus to improve our understanding on the fate and distribution of N in the aquatic environment, detailed knowledge about the subsurface hydrogeological and biogeochemical conditions, especially the redox conditions, are essential. In this study, 3D information of the redox conditions termed the redox architecture was investigated in two Danish catchments with intensive agriculture underlain by glacial deposits. Towed transient electromagnetic (tTEM) resistivity was interpreted which reveals the subsurface geological structures at a few hectare scale. These geophysical data were integrated with sediment and water chemistry for the redox architecture interpretations. The top soils of both catchments are characterized as clay-till, but the tTEM showed that the subsurface hydrogeological structures are distinctively different. We identified three types of redox architectures in the studied catchments: 1) a planar redox architecture with a single redox interface; 2) a geological-window redox architecture with local complexity; and 3) a glaciotectonic-thrusted redox architecture with high complexity. The baseflow N load at the catchment outlets reflect the contributions of N via oxic pathways through the complex redox architectures of the subsurface. We conclude that in some landscapes, the redox architecture cannot be simplified as a single interface that roughly follows the terrain; hence, thorough investigations of the structural heterogeneity of the local redox architectures will be necessary to improve simulations of N evolution along pathways and quantifications of N attenuation under various mitigation scenarios. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Glacial landscape; Hydrogeology; Nitrate transport and fate; Redox architecture; Targeted N regulations","Agriculture; Aquatic ecosystems; Biogeochemistry; Catchments; Glacial geology; Groundwater; Health risks; Hydrogeology; Runoff; Biogeochemical conditions; Glacial landscapes; Hydrogeological structures; Nitrate transport; Redox architecture; Structural heterogeneity; Targeted N regulations; Towed transient electromagnetic; Architecture; ground water; nitrogen; surface water; catchment; electrical resistivity; geological structure; glacial deposit; hydrogeology; nitrate; nitrogen; redox conditions; subsurface flow; three-dimensional modeling; transport process; aquatic environment; Article; biogeochemistry; climate change; electromagnetism; geochemistry; hydrology; landscape; oxidation reduction state; priority journal; runoff; sediment; surface property; water sampling; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073653294

We used the Model to Assess River Inputs of Nutrient to seAs (MARINA 1.0) for back-casting and scenario analysis. Avoiding coastal eutrophication by 2050 implies required reductions in river export of total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) by 50–90% for the Hai, Huai and Huang rivers. We analyzed the potential to meet these targets in 54 scenarios assuming improvements in manure recycling, fertilizer application, animal feed and wastewater treatment. Results indicate that combining manure recycling while reducing synthetic fertilizer use are effective options to reduce nutrient inputs to seas. Without such options, direct discharge of manure are important sources of water pollution. In the 7–25 scenarios with the low eutrophication potential, 40–100% of the N and P in untreated manure is recycled on land to replace synthetic fertilizers.

The broader area is degraded regarding its water availability, quality, and management. The model provides insights into water balance, net profit from agricultural activities, presents water quality data from simulations, and introduces two useful parameters informing the decision-maker’s knowledge and understanding: the deficit irrigation water’s value and a hydro-economic index which estimates (socio-)economic benefits over environmental balance. A combined demand-management plan is also examined considering the above outputs in investigating the multiple effects of the suggested policy measures.

Individual and cumulative impact from proposed and operating plants was simulated by CALPUFF for 2014. The study domain was 150 × 150 km2, with 1 × 1 km2 cell size. The effect of changing meteorological inputs and domain size were investigated with simulations. Three cases were performed using meteorological inputs: from one surface and one radiosonde station (Case 1), 22 surface and one radiosonde station (Case 2), and 22 surface and two radiosonde stations (Case 3). Case 2 and 3 resulted in higher concentrations and showed larger affected regions than case 1 in all simulations. The cumulative impact of proposed plants indicated national annual and daily limit values were exceeded in Case 2 and 3. Hourly limit values were exceeded in all three cases. Simulations for two selected proposed plants were assessed for plant impact area given in environmental impact area reports. Results indicated the plant impact areas cannot be sufficient to determine the maximum SO2 concentrations in some cases and using single meteorology station data cannot represent the study area, especially regions with complex terrain and land-sea interactions such as Çanakkale province. Cumulative impact can be underestimated due to small size of plant impact areas not including other plants. Lastly satellite retrievals are better capturing the pollution than air quality monitoring stations which are strongly affected by meteorology. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CALPUFF; Coal-fired power plants; Dispersion modeling; Environmental Impact Assessment; OMI retrievals; SO2","Air quality; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Dispersions; Environmental impact assessments; Meteorology; Odor control; Radiosondes; Satellites; Agriculture potential; Air quality monitoring stations; Calpuff; Coal-fired power plant; Dispersion modeling; Land-sea interactions; Meteorological input; OMI retrievals; Fossil fuel power plants; air quality; coal-fired power plant; concentration (composition); dispersion; environmental impact assessment; meteorology; modeling; pollution monitoring; satellite imagery; sulfur dioxide; agriculture; air quality; article; case report; cell size; clinical article; electric power plant; environmental impact assessment; information retrieval; meteorology; monitoring; simulation; tourism; Turkey (republic); air pollutant; environmental monitoring; procedures; remote sensing; space flight; theoretical model; Canakkale [Turkey]; Turkey; coal; sulfur dioxide; Air Pollutants; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Theoretical; Power Plants; Remote Sensing Technology; Spacecraft; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068268071

One of these is the SMART-Farm Tool, which measures the degree of goal achievement of farms across 327 indicators nested within 4 sustainability dimensions, 21 themes and 58 sub-themes of the FAO-SAFA Guidelines (Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture). This study aims to improve the empirical foundation of the SMART-Farm Tool by (i) evaluating the uncertainty of indicator weights obtained via expert opinion and (ii) integrating this uncertainty into SMART assessment results. An adapted Delphi process was implemented, involving a group of 67 experts from 21 countries divided into thematic and regional sub-groups. Experts within each sub-group rated the importance of indicators of all 58 SAFA sub-themes, and self-assessed their own competence. Contrary to expectations, the uncertainty in expert opinions was relatively high for environmental indicator weights (although lowest for animal welfare), being comparable to social and governance indicators. Considerable uncertainty remained in indicator weights, even after two rounds of discussion and exchange of views. This is attributed to regional variation and inherent system complexity (i.e. experts having legitimate but diverging viewpoints based on contradictory evidence) rather than scientific ignorance (i.e. a lack of research evidence). Nevertheless, it is expected that the levels of uncertainty could be reduced by limiting the number of indicators to be evaluated and thus by allowing for more in-depth discussions among the experts. Monte Carlo Simulations were used to translate residual indicator weight uncertainty into SMART assessment results at the farm level for four example farms from both developed and developing countries. The resulting comparisons revealed several cases where substantial apparent differences between farms in sustainability scores for a specific sub-theme (up to 23%) were not statistically significant, while in other cases differences of 5% were significant. This emphasizes the general importance of considering uncertainty in multi-criteria assessment tools, with clear implications real-world applications, such as product certification, labelling and marketing. Finally, this study provides important methodological suggestions for implementing expert-based assessments in multi-criteria assessments efficiently. © 2019","Agriculture; Delphi; Expert opinion; Monte Carlo Simulations; Multi-criteria assessment; Nominal Group Technique","Agricultural implements; Agriculture; Developing countries; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Delphi; Environmental indicators; Expert opinion; Multi-criteria assessment; Nominal group techniques; Product certification; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability dimensions; Sustainable development; assessment method; detection method; developing world; environmental indicator; Monte Carlo analysis; multicriteria analysis; simulation; sustainability; uncertainty analysis; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067815842

The conditional yield density inferred from premium data and its variance estimator are evaluated through simulation studies. The procedure is also applied to a crop insurance data set from the state of Iowa to examine the actuarial fairness of the premium rates.

High population and economic density has brought great pressure on water supply. Water scarcity is increasingly becoming one of the most important issues for the sustainable and healthy development of China’s urban agglomerations. In this paper, a system dynamics model was constructed to simulate the current conditions and future scenarios of urbanization development and water scarcity in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration in 2000–2030, by examining the interaction and feedback between the six major subsystems: water supply, water demand, water pollution, population urbanization, economic urbanization, and land urbanization. It is found that the South-to-North Water Diversion Project and the improved Reclaimed Water Reuse System may greatly increase the water supply. However, the speed of population urbanization and economic growth, the spatial structure of urban agglomeration and the water consumption pattern may determine the water demand. Although all scenarios may risk water scarcity in the future at some point, we could detect a comprehensive and relatively rational scenario to balance water scarcity, regional equity, and efficiency. It might help to synthetically understand the coordinated development mode between urbanization and water resources in Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration, and provide a useful analytical and decision support tool for scientists and policy-makers to achieve the sustainable urbanization development and water resource management. © 2019 by the authors.

Raumer, H.G.","The Eastern Pamir of Tajikistan is a remote high mountain region located in the east of Tajikistan. Today, a great share of the Eastern Pamir’s local energy demand is satisfied by dwarf shrubs (Krascheninnikovia ceratoides and Artemisia spp.) and animal manure. Besides of their energetic potential, dwarf shrubs are an important nutrient source for local livestock. It is assumed that overuse of local dwarf shrub stands leads to a degradation of pastures. With decreasing pasture quality, potentially, less livestock can be kept by locals. Besides of the economic losses associated with a decrease in livestock numbers, yields of manure also decline. In order to compensate the missing manure yields, locals may harvest even more dwarf shrubs. Thus, potentially a self-reinforcing functional chain exists in this system. Breckle and Wucherer (2006) refer to the degradation of pasturelands due to excessive dwarf shrub harvest in the Pamir Mountains as teresken syndrome. In a field study, we identified typical current energy carrier usage patterns in the village of Alichur, the second largest settlement in the Eastern Pamir. We then used a System Dynamics and Geographical Information Systems combining hybrid approach to analyze the energy system of Alichur and we modeled two scenarios of the system: one pessimistic in terms of dwarf shrub growth and one optimistic. Both scenarios show that in the short to medium term a collapse of the energy system of Alichur is unlikely to happen. The optimistic scenario indicates that resource consumption currently is sustainable in terms of pasture quality and dwarf shrub balance. The assumed self-reinforcing functional chain could not be confirmed. After all, the model provides strong indications that the teresken syndrome does not apply for Alichur. In addition to these findings, the case study shows, that combining SD and GIS in one model, allows for a conceptual understanding of the modeled system (mainly SD part), mass-balance simulations (SD and GIS parts) and visualization of model results (GIS part). Thereby, in addition to the case study results, this work demonstrates that System Dynamics and Geographical Information Systems combining hybrid approaches are a powerful tool for case study analysis, model simulation and result presentation. The approach is able to clarify structural assumption on the regio nal Social-Ecological-System and to support management decision. © Geoinformatics International.",,"alternative agriculture; livestock farming; manure; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; support vector machine; Pamirs; Tajikistan; Animalia; Artemisia; Krascheninnikovia ceratoides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078877318

To explore how dietary changes might influence future land systems and the environment, this research hypothesizes two potential dietary change scenarios in the period 2010-2030, based on the current trends and Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents (DGCR), and applies the CLUMondo model to simulate the spatiotemporal patterns of land systems and estimates a lifecycle's environmental impacts on dietary change. As shown in the results, dietary changes would obviously alter the land cover, agricultural intensity, and livestock density of land systems, and the changes in land use intensity are noteworthy. If the current trend of dietary change is unchecked, the intensification and expansion of agriculture and animal husbandry would be widely distributed in North China and Northwest China, where the intensity of cropland was low in the past and the ecosystem was relatively fragile. Moreover, the increasing demands for food lead to sharp increases in the carbon footprint, water footprint, and ecological footprint from food production. In contrast, the balanced diet recommended by DGCR could offer considerable environmental benefits. This diet is conducive to cutting down land use intensity, helping natural systems avoid intensification, and the expansion of agriculture and animal husbandry, which lower footprints from food production and have helped to implement the policy of returning croplands to grassland and forests in China. Therefore, popularizing balanced diets could be a win-win for human health and environmental sustainability. © 2019 by the authors.","CLUMondo; Dietary change; Land system; Land use intensity; Scenario simulation","animal husbandry; ecological footprint; environmental impact; food production; land use; life cycle analysis; nature-society relations; policy implementation; simulation; urbanization; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073625739

This paper presents the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT)-Landuse Update Tool (LUT), a standalone, user-friendly desktop-based tool for updating land use in the SWAT model that allows users to process multi-year land use data. SWAT-LUT is compatible with several SWAT model interfaces, provides users with several options to easily prepare and incorporate land use changes (LUCs) over a simulation period, and allows users to incorporate past or emerging land use categories. Incorporation of LUCs is expected to provide realistic model parameterization and scenario simulations. SWAT-LUT is a public domain interface written in Python programming language. Two applications at the Fort Cobb Reservoir Experimental Watershed located in Oklahoma and pertinent results are provided to demonstrate its use. Incorporating LUCs related to implementation of recommended conservation practices over the years reduced discharge, evapotranspiration, sediment, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus loads by 59%, 9%, 68%, 53%, and 88%, respectively.

Measures to prevent the impact of new climate conditions are expected to be extensive, costly and associated with major uncertainties. It is therefore necessary that policymakers and practitioners in both the public and private sector can compare possible mitigation measures in order to make economically rational investment decisions. For this to be successful, decision-makers need relevant decision support. This paper presents a novel approach of constructing marginal abatement cost curves for comparing water scarcity mitigation measures while taking the underlying uncertainties into account. Uncertainties in input variables are represented by probability distributions and calculations are performed using Monte Carlo simulations. This approach is applied on the island of Gotland, one of the most water-stressed parts of Sweden, to provide the first marginal abatement cost curve in Europe for water scarcity mitigation in which municipal, agricultural, industrial and household measures are compared. The results show that the agricultural measure of on-farm storage has the greatest potential to increase water availability on the island. Among municipal measures, increased groundwater extraction and desalination offer the greatest potential, although desalination is almost 25 times more costly per cubic meter.

It uses new downscaled predictions of future climate in 2050, derived from three Earth System Models calibrated with a new historical weather station dataset for Peru. This climate data is used in a three-stage socioeconomic microsimulation model that includes climate risk, and deals with the endogeneity of incomes and simultaneity of expected food consumption and its variability. We estimate the impact of CC on agricultural yields, and find results consistent and fully bounded within what the global simulations literature has found, with yields falling up to 13% in some regions. However, we show that these drops (and increases) in yields translate to much smaller changes in food consumption, and also surprisingly, to very minor impacts on vulnerability to food insecurity. The document explores what explains this surprising result, showing that in addition to characteristics that are specific to Peru, there are household and market mediating mechanisms that are available in all countries, which explain how changes in yields, and corresponding farm incomes have a reduced impact in vulnerability to food insecurity. Finally, in light of these findings, we explore which policies might have greater impact in reducing food insecurity in contexts of hunger prevalence. © 2019 Anríquez, Toledo.

To investigate the magnitude of this effect, we designed a column experiment simulating manure-treated agricultural soil that utilizes artificial subsurface drainage to determine the duration and extent which this type of manure fertilization impacts the set of genes associated with antibiotic resistance in drainage water. We classified ARGs in manure-treated drainage effluent water by its source of origin. Overall, we found that 61% and 7% of the total abundance of ARGs found in drainage water samples could be attributed to manure enrichment and manure addition, respectively. Among these ARGs, we identified 75 genes unique to manure that persisted in both soil and drainage water throughout a drainage season typical of the Upper Midwestern United States. While most of these genes gradually decreased in abundance over time, the IS6100-associated tet(33) gene accrued. These results demonstrate the influence of manure applications on the composition of the resistome observed in agricultural drainage water and highlight the importance of anthropogenic ARGs in the environment.

Agriculture is a major component of the Egyptian economy and the country's main source of food security. Urbanization is devouring vast areas of agricultural land, and therefore, in the present study, urbanization was used to determine the degree of soil sealing in a region of Kafr El Sheikh Governorate, Egypt. In this work, remote sensing data were used to monitor changes in land use and land cover (LULC) between 1984 and 2016. A field survey and population data were also used in the analysis. Support vector machine (SVM) classification was used to produce LULC maps of the study area. An accuracy assessment was performed by calculating overall accuracy and individual kappa coefficients. Additionally, soil sealing was assessed using data from 1984 to 2016, and the potential expansion of soil sealing until 2048 was simulated using the cellular automata (CA)-Markov model. Our analysis showed that in the study area (i) about 90% of the soils had soil capability degrees between class II and class III; (ii) soil sealing was not uniformly distributed in the study area; (iii) between 1984 and 2016, the area of soil sealing in fertile soils due to urbanization increased by 19,500 hectares; and (iv) between 1984 and 2000, the urban area increased by around 29%, whereas between 2000 and 2010 it increased by around 43.6%. The results suggest that the magnitude of soil sealing is a good indicator of the soil loss rate and the potential for agricultural development in the Nile Delta. The model predicted that by 2048 an area of 32,290 hectares of agricultural soil will be lost to urbanization. This study indicates that the change of LULC has a negative impact on soil sealing. Between 2000 and 2010, the area of agricultural land decreased by 4%, despite an increase in land reclamation in the north of the study area. The amount of soil sealing was found to increase towards the southeast and northeast of the study area, except for the northern parts, where the amount of soil sealing increased towards the east. Our analyses and forecasts are useful for decision-makers responsible for soil-sealing mitigation strategies and soil-sealing protection plans in the Kafr El Sheikh Governorate, Egypt. © 2019 by the authors.","GIS; Land use changes; Remote sensing; Simulation modeling; Sustainable development","agricultural development; agricultural land; agricultural soil; assessment method; cellular automaton; GIS; land reclamation; land use change; prediction; remote sensing; sealing; simulation; sustainable development; Egypt; Nile Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071990820

Due to prolonged droughts and/or irrigation demands, groundwater exploitation results in significant groundwater storage depletion. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is a promising management practice that intentionally places or retains more water in groundwater aquifers than would otherwise naturally occur. In this study, we examine the possibility of using large irrigated agricultural areas as potential MAR locations (Ag-MAR). Using the California Central Valley Groundwater-Surface Water Simulation Model we tested four different agricultural recharge land distributions, two streamflow diversion locations, eight recharge target amounts, and five recharge timings. These scenarios allowed a systematic evaluation of Ag-MAR on changes in regional, long-term groundwater storage, streamflow, and groundwater levels. The results show that overall availability of stream water for recharge is critical for Ag-MAR systems. If stream water availability is limited, longer recharge periods at lower diversion rates allow diverting larger volumes and more efficient recharge compared to shorter diversion periods with higher rates. The recharged stream water increases both groundwater storage and net groundwater contributions to streamflow. During the first decades of Ag-MAR operation, the diverted water contributed mainly to groundwater storage. After 80 years of Ag-MAR operation about 34% of the overall diverted water remained in groundwater storage while 66% discharged back to streams, enhancing base flow during months with no recharge diversions. Groundwater level rise is shown to vary with the spatial and temporal distribution of Ag-MAR. Overall, Ag-MAR is shown to provide long-term benefits for water availability, in groundwater and in streams. ©2019.

Although many global processes, such as land-use and socioeconomic change, are thought to affect mosquito-borne disease dynamics, research to date has strongly focused on the role of climate change. Here, we show, through a review of contemporary modelling studies, that no consensus on how future changes in climatic conditions will impact mosquito-borne diseases exists, possibly due to interacting effects of other global change processes, which are often excluded from analyses. We conclude that research should not focus solely on the role of climate change but instead consider growing evidence for additional factors that modulate disease risk. Furthermore, future research should adopt new technologies, including developments in remote sensing and system dynamics modelling techniques, to enable a better understanding and mitigation of mosquito-borne diseases in a changing world. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"agriculture; climate; climate change; deforestation; dengue; disease transmission; global change; human; infection; infection risk; malaria; mosquito borne disease; mosquito vector; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; socioeconomics; urbanization; climate change; computer simulation; dengue; environmental protection; global health; malaria; Agriculture; Built Environment; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Dengue; Global Health; Humans; Malaria; Mosquito Vectors; Socioeconomic Factors; Urbanization; Vector Borne Diseases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071372548

However, few attempts have been made to address the problem of minimizing at the same time the epidemic size and duration from a theoretical point of view by using optimal control theory. Here, we investigate the multi–objective optimal control problem aiming to minimize, through either vaccination or isolation, a suitable combination of epidemic size and duration when both maximum control effort and total amount of resources available during the entire epidemic period are limited. Application of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle to a Susceptible–Infected–Removed epidemic model, shows that, when the resources are not sufficient to maintain the maximum control effort for the entire duration of the epidemic, the optimal vaccination control admits only bang–bang solutions with one or two switches, while the optimal isolation control admits only bang–bang solutions with one switch. We also find that, especially when the maximum control effort is low, there may exist a trade–off between the minimization of the two objectives. Consideration of this conflict among objectives can be crucial in successfully tackling real–world problems, where different stakeholders with potentially different objectives are involved. Finally, the particular case of the minimum time optimal control problem with limited resources is discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Epidemics; Limited resources; Minimum time; Multi-objective control; Optimal control; SIR model","Agriculture; Optimal control systems; Vaccines; Epidemics; Limited resources; Minimum time; Multi-objective control; Optimal controls; SIR model; Disease control; computer simulation; epidemic; infectious disease; numerical model; size distribution; vaccination; analytic method; Article; disease duration; epidemic; health care management; health care policy; human; infection control; infection sensitivity; isolation procedure; nonhuman; process model; stakeholder engagement; vaccination; epidemic; epidemiology; patient isolation; theoretical model; time factor; vaccination; Epidemics; Epidemiologic Methods; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Patient Isolation; Time Factors; Vaccination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069672227

To maximize agricultural irrigation benefits while guaranteeing rural domestic water demand, an optimal water resources regulation model for pond irrigation districts and a simulation-based optimal water resources regulation technology system for the pond irrigation system were developed. Using this system, it was determined that the suitable pond coverage rate (pond capacity per unit area) was 2.92 × 105 m3/km2. Suitable water supply and operational rules for adjusting crop planting structure were also developed the water-saving irrigation method and irrigation system. To guarantee rural domestic water demand, the multi-year average total irrigation water deficit of the study area decreased by 4.66 × 104 m3 /km2; the average multi-year water deficit ratio decreased from 20.40% to 1.18%; the average multi-year irrigation benefit increased by 1.11 × 105 RMB (16,128$)/km2; and the average multi-year revenue increased by 6.69%.

The search for optimal land use allocations has to result in feasible solutions satisfying “real-world” constraints. We here introduce a generic and readily applicable tool to integrate user-specific spatial models (e.g. assessing different ecosystem services) for a Constrained Multi-objective Optimization of Land use Allocation (CoMOLA). The tool can handle basic land use conversion constraints by either a newly and specifically developed method to repair infeasible solutions or by penalizing constraint violation. CoMOLA was systematically tested for different levels of complexity using a virtual landscape and simple ecosystem service and biodiversity models. Our study shows that using repair mechanisms seems to be more effective in exploring the feasible solution space while penalizing constraint violation likely results in infeasible solutions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Constraint-handling; Ecosystem services; Land use allocation; Multi-objective optimization","Biodiversity; Conservation; Constrained optimization; Ecosystems; Multiobjective optimization; Potable water; Repair; Biodiversity conservation; Constrained multi-objective optimizations; Constraint handling; Constraint violation; Ecosystem services; Feasible solution spaces; Infeasible solutions; Land use allocation; Land use; biodiversity; complexity; ecosystem service; land use; optimization; resource allocation; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066450785

However, this has also sparked a debate on how the introduction of biofuels may jeopardize food security. In this paper we evaluate the effects of biofuel production on food security using system dynamics. First, we developed a system dynamics model to understand the long-term interaction between food production, biofuel production and livestock farming. Then, we calibrated and applied the model to the Colombian case. The base scenario results show that the introduction of biofuels to Colombia reduces the country's agriculture-allocated land by 2030. This, in turn, leads to a decrease in food supply and an increase in food prices. Alternative scenarios suggest that policies focused on increasing land use efficiency, especially with livestock, could have a larger impact on food security and biofuel production in Colombia. This is due to the fact that said policies foster the co-existence of bioenergy and food production. Our simulation model could be relevant to other countries in order for them to assess their food policies and biofuel strategies. The model could especially be relevant in the developing world, where similar political and environmental conditions may be present. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agro-fuel; Energy security; Food security; Policy analysis; System dynamics","Agriculture; Biofuels; Developing countries; Energy security; Food supply; Land use; Petroleum transportation; System theory; Environmental conditions; Food security; Long-term interaction; Policy analysis; System Dynamics; System dynamics approach; System dynamics model; Transportation sector; Oils and fats; bioenergy; biofuel; developing world; environmental conditions; food policy; food production; food security; livestock farming; policy analysis; Colombia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065864811

Rapid urbanization with more concentrated populations and emergent patterns of climate change (e.g., soaring temperatures and 19 years of drought) added uncertainty and complexity to the risk of water shortage for the Phoenix Metropolitan Area (PMA). In this study, we used a numerical simulation tool, termedWaterSim 5.0, to assess water sustainability indicators in PMA. Four hypothetical scenarios were evaluated, viz. desert, and green landscaping, as well as urban expansion into desert or agricultural lands, bracketing plausible paths of future development in the study area. Model outputs were evaluated using four sustainability indicators and policy controls: (1) groundwater use, (2) agricultural production, (3) personal water use, and (4) the 100-year adequate water supply metric for new population growth. All four scenarios were examined using both current (19%) and complete (100%) wastewater reclamation. We found that the rate of wastewater reuse drives a reduction in groundwater dependency in urban growth; urban-agriculture conversion provides a convenient means to enhance water sustainability. In the broader context, sustainable water planning strategies need to take into account other crucial environmental and socio-economic measures such as changes in thermal stress, agricultural production, and outdoor and rural lifestyles. © 2019 by the authors.","Arid environment; Urban development; Water sustainability; WaterSim simulations","arid environment; climate change; metropolitan area; policy making; simulation; sustainability; urban development; urbanization; wastewater; water planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068798831

In this study, we compiled a database of heavy metal concentrations in Chinese agriculture soils and selected six heavy metals for pollution assessment and risk screening: arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and Zinc (Zn). Monte Carlo simulation was employed to assess the probabilistic health risks, the associated uncertainties, as well as variations in toxicity parameters, ingestion rate and body weight. Results indicated that the concentrations of Cd were elevated above their reference standard and Cd had the highest mean geo-accumulation index (Igeo) of 1.79. Moreover, the mean hazard index (HI) through exposure to six heavy metals was 1.85E−01 and 2.87E−02 for children and adults, respectively, with 2.2% of non-cancer risks for children that exceeded the guideline value of 1. In contrast, 95.0% and 90.0% of the total cancer risks (TCR) through exposure to six heavy metals for children and adults, respectively, exceeded the guideline value of 1E−06. Six metals were ranked based on their percent of risk outputs exceeding the guideline values. Arsenic had the high exceedance of both cancer and non-cancer risks, while both Cr and Cd were metals with high concern that had high exceedance of cancer risk. Sensitivity analyses indicated that metal concentrations and ingestion rate of soil were the predominant contributors to total risk variance. Overall, the adverse health risks induced by exposure to heavy metals contaminated farmland were elevated. Results from this study may provide valuable implications for public health professionals and policy-makers to design effective strategy to manage nation-wide farmland and reduce heavy metal exposure. © 2019 The Authors","Agriculture soil; Heavy metal; Monte Carlo simulation; Probabilistic risk; Risk level ranking","Agricultural robots; Arsenic; Bioaccumulation; Cadmium; Diseases; Farms; Health risks; Heavy metals; Monte Carlo methods; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Soils; Uncertainty analysis; Agriculture soils; Geo-accumulation index; Health professionals; Heavy metal accumulation; Heavy metal concentration; Pollution assessment; Probabilistic risk; Risk levels; Soil pollution; arsenic; cadmium; chromium; heavy metal; lead; nickel; zinc; heavy metal; accumulation; agricultural soil; assessment method; concentration (composition); health risk; heavy metal; Monte Carlo analysis; probability; soil pollution; agricultural land; Article; body weight; cancer risk; China; geoaccumulation; health hazard; ingestion; Monte Carlo method; priority journal; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; soil pollution; agriculture; chemistry; environmental monitoring; human; risk factor; soil pollutant; statistical model; China; Agriculture; China; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Models, Statistical; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064929752

Formulating reliable policies to adapt to these warming levels requires an understanding of the impacts at regional and national scales. The present study examines the potential impacts of the different global warming levels (1.5 °C and above) on climate extremes over Botswana, one of the most vulnerable countries to extreme climate events. Using a series of regional climate model simulations from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX), we investigate the impacts of the warming on characteristics of the rainy season (onset, cessation, length, and number of wet days), extreme precipitation, and droughts. The simulations project a short length of the rainy season with a reduced number of wet days over Botswana at all the warming levels. They also indicate more frequent and intensified extreme precipitation, particularly in north-west Botswana. However, the additional rain water from the extreme rainfall may not offset the deficit in rainfall amount induced by the shorter rainy season with fewer wet days. Drought intensity and frequency are also projected to increase, but the magnitude of changes increases with higher warming levels. The policy implications of projected changes are discussed in relation to the possible impacts on society using agriculture and water availability as examples. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Drought; Global warming; Public policy; Rain; Drought intensities; Extreme precipitation; Policy implications; Potential impacts; Pre-industrial levels; Regional climate; Regional climate model simulation; Water availability; Climate models; adaptive management; climate change; climate modeling; environmental policy; global warming; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; regional climate; temperature effect; water availability; Botswana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065337977

We report that the total N 2 O emissions in China increased by 140% from 1978 to 2015, with croplands being the major emitters accounting for 35–48% of the emissions. Over the last 15 years, N 2 O emissions from industry, aquaculture and waste management have grown rapidly, while those from cropland, livestock, grassland, and human consumption have grown slowly. The spatial differences in China make the assessments of N 2 O emission patterns complex. Compared with other greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride) reported by the World Bank, we found that N 2 O emissions contributed approximately 9–20% (carbon dioxide equivalent) of the major greenhouse gas emissions from 1978 to 2012 in China. The growth rate of N 2 O emissions in China was 1.8 times greater than that throughout the world between 1978 and 2012. Additionally, we assessed the mitigation potential for various measures from the perspectives of production and consumption. The results show that knowledge-based nitrogen management (including the application of controlled-release nitrogen fertilizer, nitrification inhibitor and urease inhibitor, and optimal nitrogen fertilizer rate based on soil nitrogen tests), large farm sizes, flue gas denitration and healthy diet habits are effective strategies to cope with the continued growth of N 2 O emissions. The results of these quantitative scenario simulations are critical for the formulation and implementation of corresponding policy measures. © 2019","Greenhouse gases; Mitigation; Nitrous oxide; Policy implications; Spatial variation; Temporal evolution","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; Growth rate; Knowledge based systems; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Public policy; Sulfur dioxide; Sulfur hexafluoride; Waste management; Mitigation; Nitrous oxide; Policy implications; Spatial variations; Temporal evolution; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063336937

This study applied a novel environmental sustainability assessment tool using dynamic Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) simulations for model estimation of the relationships between greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy, biomass, food and economic growth for Australia using data spanning from 1970 to 2017. The study found an inversed-U shaped relationship between energy consumption and income level, showing a decarbonized and services economy, hence, improved energy efficiency. While energy consumption increases emissions by 0.4 to 2.8%, biomass consumption supports Australia's transition to a decarbonized economy by reducing GHG emissions by 0.13% and shifts the demand for fossil fuel. Food and energy consumption underpin socio-economic development and vice versa. However, food waste from production and consumption increases ecological footprint, implying a lost opportunity to improve food security and reduce environmental pressure from agricultural production.

This is explained by the fact that groundwater is an important component of the hydrological cycle, since it is a source of natural enrichment for rivers, lakes, and wetlands and constitutes the main source of potable water. The need of aquifers simulation, taking into account water resources components at watershed level, is imperative for the choice of appropriate restoration management practices. An integrated water resources modeling approach, using hydrological modeling tools, is presented for assessing the nitrate fate and transport on an over-exploited aquifer with intensive and extensive agricultural activity under various operational strategies and future climate change scenarios. The results indicate that climate change affects nitrates concentration in groundwater, which is likely to be increased due to the depletion of the groundwater table and the decrease of groundwater enrichment in the future water balance. Application of operational agricultural management practices with the construction and use of water storage infrastructure tend to compensate the groundwater resources degradation due to climate change impacts. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Groundwater nitrate contamination; Integrated water resources modeling; Lake Karla aquifer","Agriculture; Aquifers; Climate change; Groundwater pollution; Hydrogeology; Lakes; Nitrates; Potable water; Agricultural activities; Agricultural management practice; Agricultural practices; Groundwater nitrates; Hydrological modeling; Integrated water resources modeling; Operational strategies; Over-exploited aquifers; Groundwater resources; agricultural management; agricultural practice; aquifer; climate change; groundwater pollution; groundwater resource; hydrological cycle; hydrological modeling; integrated approach; management practice; nitrate; water resource; water storage; Greece; Karla Lake; Magnesia; Thessaly",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068573971

Chronic exposure to mycotoxins is a risk factor for human diseases as it is implicated in the development of cancer, neural tube defects as well as stunting in children. Although authorities may set maximum levels, these regulations are not effective in subsistence farming communities. As maize is consumed in large quantities, exposure to mycotoxins will surpass safe levels even where the contamination levels are below the regulated maximum levels. It is clear that the lowering of exposure in these communities requires an integrated approach. Detailed understanding of agricultural practices, mycotoxin occurrence, climate change/weather patterns, human exposure and risk are warranted to guide adequate intervention programmes. Risk communication and creating awareness in affected communities are also critical. A range of biologically based products for control of mycotoxigenic fungi and mycotoxins in maize have been developed and commercialised. Application of these methods is limited due to a lack of infrastructure and resources. Other challenges regarding integration and sustainability of technological and community-based mycotoxin reduction strategies include (i) food security, and (ii) the traditional use of mouldy maize. © 2019 by the authors.

We propose an economywide systems-approach that combines ex post household econometric analysis (using propensity score matching) of investment impacts with ex ante modeling of growth and poverty linkages (using a spatially-disaggregated dynamic computable general equilibrium model). We apply this approach retrospectively to Mozambique. Simulation results indicate that the country's investment plan from 2012 to 2017 would not achieve national growth targets, despite doubling public spending on agriculture. Rather than increasing spending, the government should have reallocated resources towards agricultural research and extension, instead of irrigation and fertilizer subsidies. Providing extension services to smallholders is most effective at raising growth and reducing poverty in all regions of the country. Investing in irrigation was more likely benefit growth in the country's southern region due to less favorable agroecological conditions. These conclusions are robust across assumptions about investment efficiency. As demonstrated in Mozambique, our approach provides a consistent framework for evaluating ex ante sector-wide agricultural investment plans based on growth, poverty and regional equity considerations. Our approach complements household-level evaluations by enhancing their relevance for national planning. © 2018","Agriculture; CGE model; Growth; Impact evaluation; Investment; Poverty","agroecology; economic conditions; economic growth; fertilizer application; growth; irrigation system; poverty; resource allocation; Mozambique",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042909738

The use of process-based crop models as components of integrated models offers the possibility of significantly improving such analyses; however, challenges exist in terms of simulation scales and degree of integration. Therefore, this study evaluates the applicability of coarser-than-daily simulation time steps to simulate long-term crop yields in integrated models, and the impacts of aggregated weather input data on yields for a water-driven crop-process model based on the FAO AquaCrop model. We ran simulations at daily, semi-weekly, and weekly time steps in conjunction with coarser temporal resolution (weekly) weather input data for three crops in four locations over ten years to represent a range of crops and growing environments. Simulation results were compared to a reference case from AquaCrop using daily time step with daily weather data. Model skill for simulating crop biomass and yield and water demands was assessed statistically for each of these four hypothetical farms. Visual representations were also used to compare simulated soil moisture, crop canopy, and actual evapotranspiration values. Weekly climate data led to overestimation of crop biomass and yield regardless of the time step used. High agreements and low bias errors were realized for crop production and water estimates at daily and semi-weekly time steps, whereas weekly simulations showed poorer performance. Longer time steps intensified the impacts of weather input data aggregation, and overestimation became more pronounced with increases in time step length. The findings have important implications for integrated assessments that couple crop models with other socioeconomic, environmental, or hydrologic models, and provide guidance for modelers involved in interdisciplinary agricultural and water resources applications, including policy assessments, evaluation of water and food security, and resource use and efficiency under climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural systems; Integrated assessment; Process-based crop model; System dynamics; Temporal aggregation; Time step","water; accuracy assessment; agricultural modeling; assessment method; biomass; climate change; crop production; crop yield; evapotranspiration; farming system; food security; integrated approach; resource use; temporal analysis; Article; calculation; canopy; climate change; crop production; data aggregation; evapotranspiration; food security; growing season; harvest; measurement accuracy; precipitation; process model; simulation; soil moisture; soil water content; step length; weather; agriculture; crop; crop production; theoretical model; Agriculture; Climate Change; Crop Production; Crops, Agricultural; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062696983

It undergoes periodic, human-induced and natural biomass burning during the dry season, which is shorter in Colombia. Northeast trade winds that prevail during the dry season can transport biomass burning plumes from Venezuela to Colombia, even during the Colombian Llanos wet season. Our analysis is based on ambient air measurements at two middle size Colombian Llanos cities located 266 km apart, during April–May 2015, right after the end of the dry season in Colombia, but when there was still high fire activity in Venezuela. Observed 24-h averaged PM10 concentrations in the two cities were unexpectedly high (up to 112 μg/m3), particularly when considering their relatively small size, and low industrial and road traffic activity, and their trends were very similar, which indicates a common remote source. Ozone enhancements of up to ∼94 ppbv (7-day average) were also observed. A reasonably good correlation was found between PM10 and a proxy of fire emissions within footprints calculated using the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport model.

The evaluation of climate change impact on water productivity inferred by crop yield and actual evapotranspiration is of significant importance for water-saving in agricultural regions. In this study, the multi-model projections of climate change under the three Representative Concentration Pathways emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) were used to drive an agro-hydrological model to evaluate the crop water productivity in the middle irrigated oases of the HRB from 2021–2050. Compared with the water productivity simulation based on field experiments during 2012–2015, the projected water productivity in the two typical agricultural areas (Gaotai and Ganzhou) both exhibited an increasing trend in the future 30 years, which was mainly attributed to the significant decrease of the crop water consumption. The water productivity in the Gaotai area under the three RCP scenarios during 2021–2050 increased by 9.2%, 14.3%, and 11.8%, while the water productivity increased by 15.4%, 21.6%, and 19.9% in the Ganzhou area, respectively.

The work was motivated by a number of factors, including a request from U.S. Department of Agriculture Undersecretary James Hubbard (Natural Resources and Environment) to assess community wildfire risk specifically from Forest Service lands, language in the 2018 omnibus bill (Public Law 115-141) calling for a national assessment of wildfire risk to communities, and newer shared stewardship initiatives (Clavet 2018). We used national FSim simulation outputs to (1) estimate cross-boundary wildfire among major land types (Federal, State, private); (2) quantify structure exposure to all western communities; (3) map sources of community wildfire exposure (firesheds); (4) characterize firesheds in terms of management opportunity and fuels; and (5) prioritize communities based on integration of exposure and fireshed characteristics. The study revealed that 1,812 communities in the western U.S. could potentially be significantly impacted by future wildfires (more than 1 structure per year on average). Ignitions on national forest lands will most likely affect 516 of these 1,812 communities (more than one structure per year on average). Of the total exposure, ignitions on national forest lands will expose an estimated 4,000 structures (21 percent of total) in the western U.S. per year on average. Due to administrative restrictions on national forest lands, only about half of the total exposure from national forest lands (2,200 structures) originates on lands where mechanical treatments and prescribed fire are either allowed or ecologically appropriate. The framework can guide future efforts aimed at quantifying community and other cross-boundary exposure situations, and the outputs can be used to help identify shared stewardship projects, and prioritize fuel and other management activities within public land management agencies. © 2019, USDA Forest Service.

However, in conventional agricultural land management, soil erosion may be boosted up to 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than the natural rates of soil production, making unproductive about the 30% of the world’s arable. Nowadays in Europe, vineyards represent the most erosion-prone agricultural lands, especially in Mediterranean countries, showing the highest erosion rates in comparison to other type of land uses. Prosecco wine is produced in NE Italy by a rate of 400 M bottles per year, with the fastest growing demand in the global market at present. A production of 90 M bottles year-1 is currently running in the historical Prosecco DOCG (215 km2), in a steep hilly landscape of Veneto Region (Conegliano-Valdobbiadene). To sustain wine production, agricultural intensification is at present increasing, by re-setting of hillslopes and land use changes towards new vineyard plantations. The aim of this study is to estimate and to map potential soil erosion rate, calculating a sort of “soil footprint” for wine production in different agricultural land-management scenarios. RUSLE model was adopted to estimate potential soil erosion in Mg ha−1 year−1, by using high resolution topographic data (LiDAR), 10 years rainfall data analysis, detailed land use and local soil characteristics. For a conventional land-management scenario the estimated that total potential soil erosion in the Prosecco DOCG area is 411,266 Mg year-1, with an erosion rate of 19.5 Mg ha year-1. Modelled soil erosion is mainly clustered on steep slopes, with rates higher than 40 Mg ha-1 year-1. In Prosecco vineyards potential soil erosion could reach 300,180 Mg year-1, by a mean rate of 43.7 Mg ha-1 year-1, which is 31 times higher than the upper limit of tolerable soil erosion threshold defined for Europe. In contrast, simulation of different nature-based scenarios (hedgerows, buffer strips, and grass cover) showed soil erosion could be effectively reduced: a 100% inter-row grass cover showed a reduction of almost 3 times in vineyards (from 43.7 to 14.6 Mg ha-1 year-1), saving about 50% of soil in the whole Prosecco DOCG. The soil footprint modelled for a conventional land-management scenario is about 3.3 kg every bottle produced; in contrast it would be reduced to 1.1 kg/bottle in the completely green land-management scenario. This study, as the first estimation of potential soil erosion at Prosecco DOCG scale, suggests that an integrated and public soil erosion monitoring system is strongly needed in viticultural area, by implementing direct/indirect field measures with spatial analyses at agricultural landscape scale. © 2019 Pappalardo et al.

The development of robust strategies to cope with the region's climatic challenges requires thorough consideration of uncertainty and risk in decision making. We demonstrate the use of probabilistic decision analysis to compare intervention options to prevent reservoir sedimentation in Burkina Faso. To illustrate this approach, we developed a causal impact pathway model based on the local knowledge of expert stakeholders. Input parameters were described by probability distributions derived from estimated confidence intervals. The model was run in a Monte Carlo simulation to generate the range of plausible decision outcomes, quantified as the net present value and the annual cash flow. We used Partial Least Squares regression analysis to identify the parameters that most affected projected intervention outcomes and we computed the Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) to highlight critical uncertainties. Numerical results show that the preferred intervention to secure agricultural production is a combination of dredging, rock dams and a buffer scheme around the reservoir. The EVPI calculation reveals an information value for the profit per ton of vegetables, indicating that more information on this variable would be useful for supporting the decision. However, without the need for follow-up analysis, the results show high probability of benefits given the combined interventions, which, given the current state of information, should be preferred over inaction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Burkina Faso; Decision analysis; Monte-Carlo simulation; Reservoir sedimentation; Uncertainty assessment","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate change; Decision making; Decision theory; Least squares approximations; Monte Carlo methods; Probability distributions; Regression analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Agricultural productions; Burkina Faso; Partial least squares regression analysis; Probabilistic decisions; Reservoir protection; Reservoir sedimentation; Uncertainty and risks; Uncertainty assessment; Reservoirs (water); agricultural production; arid region; climate change; decision analysis; decision making; Monte Carlo analysis; sedimentation; simulation; stakeholder; strategic approach; traditional knowledge; uncertainty analysis; Burkina Faso; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062154196

Losses are mitigated through increased use of disease-related biosecurity practices, making increased biosecurity an industry goal. Currently, there is no industry-wide standard for sharing information about disease incidence or on-site biosecurity strategies, resulting in uncertainty regarding disease prevalence and biosecurity strategies employed by industry stakeholders. Using an experimental simulation game, with primarily student participants, we examined willingness to invest in biosecurity when confronted with disease outbreak scenarios. We varied the scenarios by changing the information provided about 1) disease incidence and 2) biosecurity strategy or response by production facilities to the threat of disease. Here we show that willingness to invest in biosecurity increases with increased information about disease incidence, but decreases with increased information about biosecurity practices used by nearby facilities. Thus, the type or context of the uncertainty confronting the decision maker may be a major factor influencing behavior. Our findings suggest that policies and practices that encourage greater sharing of disease incidence information should have the greatest benefit for protecting herd health.

This study explores future urban expansion in the rapidly growing region of eastern lowland Nepal. We used the hybrid cellular automata-Markov (CA-Markov) model, which utilizes historical land use and land cover (LULC) maps and several biophysical change driver variables to predict urban expansion for the years 2026 and 2036. Transitional area matrices were generated based on historical LULC data from 1996 to 2006, from 2006 to 2016, and from 1996 to 2016. The approach was validated by cross comparing the actual and simulated maps for 2016. Evaluation gave satisfactory values of Kno (0.89), Kstandard (0.84), and Klocation (0.89) which verifies the accuracy of the model. Hence, the CA-Markov model was utilized to simulate the LULC map for the years 2026 and 2036. The study area experienced rapid peri/urban expansion and sharp decline in area of cultivated land during 1989–2016. Built-up area increased by 110.90 km 2 over a period of 27 years at the loss of 87.59 km 2 cultivated land. Simulation analysis indicates that urban expansion will continue with urban cover increasing to 230 km 2 (8.95%) and 318.51 km 2 (12.45%) by 2026 and 2036, respectively, with corresponding declines in cultivated land to 1453.83 km 2 (56.86%) and 1374.93 km 2 (53.77%) for the same years. The alarming increase in urban areas coupled with loss of cultivated land will have negative implications for food security and environmental equilibrium in the region. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CA-Markov; Developing countries; Food security; Spatial models; Urban expansion","Cultivation; Developing countries; Expansion; Food supply; Land use; Markov processes; CA-Markov; Food security; Hybrid cellular automatons; Land use and land cover; Simulation analysis; Spatial models; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Urban expansion; Urban growth; accuracy assessment; cellular automaton; computer simulation; developing world; future prospect; Markov chain; numerical model; planning process; policy making; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; urban growth; urban planning; urbanization; article; cultivated land; developing country; driver; food security; human; human cell; landscape; Nepal; simulation; urban area; agriculture; catering service; city planning; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; housing; Markov chain; Nepal; urbanization; Nepal; Tarai; Agriculture; City Planning; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Food Supply; Housing; Humans; Markov Chains; Nepal; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063658833

As we head into a new era of civilization, population increase and modernized lifestyles have led to an increasing need for water, energy, and food. However, severe hydrological precipitation significantly impacts agricultural harvest, and such influence becomes more apparent under the influence of climate change. Meanwhile, the major method of electricity generation (i.e., fossil fuel burning) has a negative impact on the environment. These inevitable threats are crucial and have to be dealt with for a society on the road towards sustainability. In the present study, an integrated evaluation of the WEF nexus was conducted for two areas with different levels of urbanization using empirical multiple linear regression in a simultaneous equation model (SEM). By incorporating the collected data into the SEM, the weighting coefficient of each identified variable was obtained, and the nexus implication was assessed in model simulation at different scenarios considering the population growth, agro-technology advancement, energy structure improvement, and available water resources. In the simulated results, three observations were found: (1) the rural area is more sustainable than the urban one; (2) the sustainability for both the investigated areas is significantly subject to their water supply and demand; and (3) food production was found to have a less important effect on the sustainable development of the urban area. This study identified the key factors in the WEF nexus exploration, which are economically and environmentally important for resource allocation. An empirical model was developed to correlate sustainable achievement with WEF management, as well as strategic policies that should be implemented under the pressure of urbanization. © 2019 by the authors.

Whereas increased care in causal identification in such analyses is beneficial and has improved the quality of research in this field, much of the literature still fails to investigate the costs needed to achieve any benefits identified. Such understanding, however, would be crucial for drawing policy and programmatic conclusions from the research and for informing the allocation of public investments. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) subjects both the cost side and the effects side of agricultural and rural interventions to technical scrutiny and unifies both sides in order to compare the relative cost-effectiveness of different modalities of a programme, of efforts to reach different target groups, or of efforts to achieve different outcomes. CEAs, while present in the health and education sectors, remain rare in agricultural and rural development research. This study contributes to filling the knowledge gap by conducting CEAs in a particular type of programmatic work in the agricultural sector—namely, interventions conducted as field experiments that bring a gender lens to community-based advisory services in African rural areas. Specifically, we consider two such programmes—one in Mozambique in which such advisory services aim to improve sustainable land management (SLM) practices in agricultural production, and the other in Tanzania to advise farmers on their land rights. Using CEA methods combined with econometric analysis based on randomised controlled trials, we find that the gendered modality is consistently more cost-effective than the basic modality when considering varied outcomes and target groups. However, for any given modality, it is more cost-effective to improve outcomes for men than for women. The structure of costs in the agricultural extension programme further allowed for a simulation of how cost-effectiveness would change if the programme were scaled up geographically. The results show that expansion of the basic modality of the SLM programme leads to improvements in cost-effectiveness, while the gendered modality displays nonlinear changes in cost-effectiveness along the expansion path, first worsening with initial scale-up and subsequently improving with further expansion. © 2019 Mogues et al.

Land-use simulation is a well suited but underutilized tool in this regard. As a case study for the application of land-use simulation to assess the impact of protected areas, we present a scenario analysis exploring conservation options in Canada's western boreal forest. The cumulative effect of multiple natural resource sectors, including oil and gas, forestry, and agriculture, have substantially altered the region's ecosystems in recent decades and elevated risk to wildlife. The evolving state of the region is such that managing risks to biodiversity requires consideration of not only today's but also tomorrow's conditions. We simulated the long-term (50-year) outcomes of land use and protection to caribou, fisher, fish, and resource production in each of 104 watersheds in the 693,345 km 2 study area. Simulated land use caused increased risk to wildlife in response to northwards expansion of resource extraction and expansion of agricultural lands. For each watershed, indicator performance with and without protection were compared to calculate the benefit (avoided ecological loss) and cost (lost opportunity for resource production) of protection. The capacity for protected areas to avoid disturbance varied substantially across watersheds, as did the potential loss of economic opportunity. Focusing protection on cost-effective watersheds made protected area expansion a more efficient strategy for reducing wildlife risk than reducing the overall rate of natural resource production. Heterogeneity in the cost-effectiveness of protection presents an opportunity to balance ecological integrity and economic growth. © 2019 The Authors","Boreal forest; Caribou; Conservation planning; Cumulative effects; Land-use simulation; Protected area impact; Scenario analysis","biodiversity; boreal forest; conservation planning; expansion; land use planning; protected area; risk factor; scenario analysis; wildlife management; Canada; Rangifer tarandus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060349588

We present three stylized scenarios to demonstrate the potential economy-wide impacts of both soil nutrient loss and replenishment, and how foreign aid can be targeted to support agricultural inputs that boost rural productivity and shift labor to boost real wages. One simulation shows how a temporary program of targeted official development assistance (ODA) for agriculture could generate, contrary to traditional Dutch disease concerns, an expansion in the primary tradable sector and positive permanent productivity and welfare effects, leading to a steady decline in the need for complementary ODA for budget support. © 2018 The Author.

Estimation of GSPs is the most difficult aspect of most modelling exercises because it requires expensive and time-consuming field experiments. GSPs could also be estimated using multi-year and multi locational data from breeder evaluation experiments. This research was set up with the following objectives: i) to determine GSPs of 10 newly released maize varieties for the Nigerian Savannas using data from both calibration experiments and by using existing data from breeder varietal evaluation trials; ii) to compare the accuracy of the GSPs generated using experimental and breeder data; and iii) to evaluate CERES-Maize model to simulate grain and tissue nitrogen contents. For experimental evaluation, 8 different experiments were conducted during the rainy and dry seasons of 2016 across the Nigerian Savanna. Breeder evaluation data were also collected for 2 years and 7 locations. The calibrated GSPs were evaluated using data from a 4-year experiment conducted under varying nitrogen rates (0, 60 and 120kg N ha -1 ). For the model calibration using experimental data, calculated model efficiency (EF) values ranged between 0.88–0.94 and coefficient of determination (d-index) between 0.93–0.98. Calibration of time-series data produced nRMSE below 7% while all prediction deviations were below 10% of the mean. For breeder experiments, EF (0.58–0.88) and d-index (0.56–0.86) ranges were lower. Prediction deviations were below 17% of the means for all measured variables. Model evaluation using both experimental and breeder trials resulted in good agreement (low RMSE, high EF and d-index values) between observed and simulated grain yields, and tissue and grain nitrogen contents. It is concluded that higher calibration accuracy of CERES-Maize model is achieved from detailed experiments. If unavailable, data from breeder experimental trials collected from many locations and planting dates can be used with lower but acceptable accuracy. © 2019 Adnan et al.

We estimate the impact of the subsidy on organic fruit demand in a representative poor, middle income, and rich US household using three analytical methods; including two econometric and one machine learning. We do not find strong evidence of regressive redistribution due to our simulated organic fruit subsidy; the poor household’s relative reaction to the subsidy is not much different than the reaction at the other two households.

The agricultural sector is the economic sector that will be most affected by this phenomenon. Thinking of adequate adaptation policies to increase the resilience of certain agricultural production systems is a fundamental condition for ensuring the sustainability of agricultural activity, especially irrigated agriculture. To assess the degree of resilience of irrigated agricultural production systems in the central-eastern region of Tunisia, case of Kalâa Kebira, a bio-economic model was applied to analyze the impact of two scenarios. The first represents only the variation of climate change while in the second one, we add an integrated policy based on the pricing of irrigation water and the subsidy of the purchase cost of seasonal potato seeds. The results of the simulation confirmed the negative economic and environmental impacts of climate change on small scale intensive farms and also large farms in general. The intervention of the public government through an integrated policy is likely to improve the degree of resilience of farms through a compromise between the economic objective (the agricultural income) and the environmental objective (soil salinity) for semi-intensive farms in the study area. © 2019 Greek Association of Agricultural Economists.

If autonomous vehicles become the main means of transportation in the future, people can pass their time on the road by reading, eating, and interacting with friends. People will no longer have the burden of having to drive, and this will change people's perception of travel time. In addition, this will have an impact on people's choice of residence. Previous studies have already argued that if autonomous vehicles become commonplace, the city will become suburbanized. However, previous studies have not presented specific models or figures about such future cities. Therefore, this paper seeks to suggest specific models of land use change when autonomous vehicles are dominant through the cellular automata method. For land use, residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, social, public, and green areas are considered, and accessibility, land price, accessibility to green spaces, and neighborhood effects are selected as land use change factors. Simulations based on the scenarios presented in this paper by Heinrichs show two representative results. First, most agricultural areas will decrease, and residential and commercial areas in Gyeonggi province will expand. Second, most land usage will change to residential land use, and only the central commercial area in Seoul will remain. This result can serve as a guideline for urban planning when autonomous vehicles become the main means of transportation. Furthermore, this paper could be helpful for the development of regulations and policy enforcement around autonomous vehicles. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This was done through simulation and the comparison of the three land cover scenarios such as 2015 land cover, 2025 projected land cover and desired land use to determine its difference in terms of runoff. Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System was used for simulating runoff. The geographic Information system was used for the preparation of the land use/cover and as an interface between GIS and HEC-HMS. Based on the result, 2025 land cover values in runoff volume and peak outflow increase from 2015 land cover while decrease in desired land use. There is shorter time to peak in 2025 land cover than desired land use. The 2025 land cover, represented the land cover without intervention, showed that agriculture will dominate the area with 78.28% of the total area, closed canopy forest and open forest cover will reduce with 4.57% and 6.78% of the total area respectively. The desired land use represented the sound land use management, showed that there will be 13.9% decreased in agriculture. This can, however, result to increase in close canopy forest (112.3%), grassland (125.7%), and open forest (4.3%). The study showed that desired land use will most likely reduce the magnitude of the flood than the 2015 and 2025 land covers. Thus, adopting sound land use management in Tamontaka river basin is crucial to reduce runoff and thereby mitigate flooding in the study area. © 2019 GJESM.","Flood Mitigation; Geographic Information System (GIS); HEC-HMS; Land Cover; Land Use",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075615252

In Sahelian countries, irregular spatial and temporal rainfall distribution remains a threat for rainfed agriculture despite the use of a wide range of techniques for soil conservation. Objectives. To analyze several irrigation strategies for rainfed crops and to assess the likely economic incentives to support the adoption of supplemental irrigation from farm ponds in response to dry spells. Method. The supplemental irrigation strategies and economic incentives were analyzed using an applied bio-economic model in a typical farm. Results. The simulations showed that supplemental irrigation from small individual ponds would increase farmers’ income compared to the situation without irrigation. Maize, sorghum and millet production under supplemental irrigation in a dry year would increase expected income by 26.49% (133,030 CFA francs equivalent to 202.80 euros) compared to the situation without irrigation. Simulations with incentives to promote supplemental irrigation focused on four subsidy modalities and the introduction of a credit system for agricultural households. Conclusions. Of the incentives studied, the food-for-work subsidy to mobilize labor for basin building seems particularly suitable for scaling-up supplemental irrigation. © 2019 FAC UNIV SCIENCES AGRONOMIQUES GEMBLOUX.

Given a dataset of organic dairy certifications we simulated spatio-temporal networks based on the location of existing and new organic dairy farming operations. The simulations were performed with different probabilities of connecting with existing or incoming organic farmer operations, to overcome the lack of data describing actual connections between farmers. Calculated network statistics on the simulated networks included the average degree, average shortest path, closeness (centrality), clustering coefficients, and the relative size of the largest cluster, to demonstrate how the networks evolved over time. The findings revealed that new organic dairy operations cluster around existing ones, reflecting the role of networks in the conversion into organic production. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we contribute to the literature on clustering, information sharing, and market development in the agri-food industry by analyzing the potential implications of social networking in the development of a relatively new agriculture market. Second, we add to the literature on empirical social networks by using a new dataset with information on actors not previously studied analytically. © 2019 by the authors.","Geographical networks; Market dynamics; Organic dairy; Social network analysis; Temporal networks","agricultural market; agroindustry; dairy farming; market development; network analysis; organic farming; social network; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063440325

In the present paper, I discuss the value to agriculture from AI over the next decade. The more immediate applications will be to improve precision information about what is happening on the farm by improving what is being detected and measured. A consequence of this are more accurate alerts to farmers. Another is an increased ability to understand why phenomena occur in farm systems, so as to improve their management. From improved data and understanding come improved predictions, enabling more optimal decisions about how to manage farm systems and stimulating the development of decision support and recommender systems. In many cases, robotics and automated systems will remove much of the need for human decision-making and improve farm efficiencies and farm health. Artificial intelligence will also be needed to enable organisations to harness the value of information distributed throughout supply chains, including farm data. Digital twins will also emerge as an important paradigm to improve how information about farm entities is organised to support decision-making. There are also likely to be negative impacts from AI, such as disruption to the roles and skills needed from farm workers, indicating the need to consider the social and ethical impacts of AI each time a new capability is introduced. I conclude that understanding these challenges more deeply tends to highlight new opportunities for positive change. © 2020 CSIRO.","digital twin; precision; robotics; supply chain; traceability","artificial intelligence; computer simulation; data acquisition; decision making; detection method; optimization; precision; robotics; supply chain management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057276288

The paper extends the existing literature by investigating the effects of two implementation issues: level of aggregation of mutual funds (MF); definition of farmers’ contribution (i.e. premium) to MF. We use a simulation approach based on a FADN panel data set of 3421 farms over a period of 7 years to investigate effects on (i) farm-level income variability, (ii) the expected level and variability of indemnifications at the level of mutual funds and (iii) the distribution of net benefits from this policy instrument across the farm population. We find that the introduction of the IST would lead to a significant reduction of income variability in Italian agriculture. Our results support the establishment of a national mutual fund due to the high volatility of indemnification levels at more disaggregated (e.g. regional or sectoral) levels. In addition, our results propose that farmers’ contribution to mutual funds, i.e. premiums paid, should be modulated according to farm size as this reduces the inequality of the distribution of benefits of such tool within the farm population. © 2018 The Society for Policy Modeling","Income stabilisation tool; Mutual funds; Policy implementation; Risk-management policies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046153485

The model is a spatio-temporal exposure-hazard model based on (i) tools of stochastic geometry (marked polygon and point processes) for structuring the landscape and describing the exposed individuals, (ii) a dispersal kernel describing the dissemination of contaminants from polygon sources, and (iii) an (eco)toxicological equation describing the toxicokinetics and dynamics of contaminants in affected individuals. The model was implemented in the briskaR package (biological risk assessment with R) of the R software. This article presents the model background, the use of the package in an illustrative example, namely, the effect of genetically modified maize pollen on nontarget Lepidoptera, and typical comparisons of landscape configurations that can be carried out with our model (different configurations lead to different mortality rates in the treated example). In real case studies, parameters and parametric functions encountered in the model will have to be precisely specified to obtain realistic measures of risk and impact and accurate comparisons of landscape configurations. Our modeling framework could be applied to study other risks related to agriculture, for instance, pathogen spread in crops or livestock, and could be adapted to cope with other hazards such as toxic emissions from industrial areas having health effects on surrounding populations. Moreover, the R package has the potential to help risk managers in running quantitative risk assessments and testing management strategies. © 2017 Society for Risk Analysis","Environmental risk assessment; GMO; landscape management; particle dispersal; stochastic geometry","Agriculture; Biochemistry; Biohazards; Geometry; Health hazards; Health risks; Industrial emissions; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Environmental risk assessment; Genetically modified maize; Landscape configuration; Landscape management; Management strategies; Quantitative risk assessment; Spatiotemporal distributions; Stochastic geometry; Risk assessment; comparative study; dispersal; ecotoxicology; environmental impact assessment; environmental risk; genetically modified organism; hazard assessment; health impact; industrial emission; landscape planning; nontarget organism; numerical model; pollution exposure; public health; risk assessment; simulation; software; spatiotemporal analysis; stochasticity; Lepidoptera; Zea mays; xenobiotic agent; agriculture; algorithm; animal; biological model; butterfly; chemistry; computer simulation; crop; ecology; genetic engineering; genetics; human; livestock; maize; plant disease; pollen; procedures; proportional hazards model; risk assessment; software; toxicology; transgenic organism; Agriculture; Algorithms; Animals; Butterflies; Computer Simulation; Crops, Agricultural; Ecology; Genetic Engineering; Humans; Livestock; Models, Biological; Organisms, Genetically Modified; Plant Diseases; Pollen; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Assessment; Software; Toxicology; Xenobiotics; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038213898

The current French national inventory is based on default emission factors (EF) and does not account for the main variables influencing NH3 emissions. To model the spatio-temporal variability of NH3 emissions due to mineral and organic N fertilization, we implemented a new method named CADASTRE_NH3. The novelty lies in the combined use of two types of resources: the process-based Volt'Air model and geo-referenced and temporally explicit databases for soil properties, meteorological conditions and N fertilization. Simulation units are the Small Agricultural Regions. Several sources of information were combined to obtain N fertilization management: census and surveys of the French Ministry of Agriculture, statistics on commercial fertilizer deliveries, and French expertise on physicochemical properties of organic manure. The practical interest of this new framework was illustrated for France during the crop year 2005/06. Aggregation at crop year level showed a reasonable agreement between estimated values derived from CADASTRE_NH3 and those from the French inventory method, for N and ammoniacal-N (TAN) application rates, total NH3 emissions and NH3 EF. Discrepancies were large for organic manure only; national TAN application rates and NH3 emissions were 62–63% lower with CADASTRE_NH3. This was due to divergences in the representation of cattle farm yard manure and in the TAN:N ratio of solid manure. Annual emissions for fertilization in France were estimated to be 270 Gg NH3, 29% lower than the French national inventory estimate. At the regional level, organic manure contributed to 73% of field NH3 emissions in intensive livestock husbandry areas and to 41% in the other areas. The CADASTRE_NH3 framework can be seen as a Tier 3 approach able to estimate specific regional EF for different mineral fertilizers and organic manure. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","CADASTRE_NH3; Cultural practices; Emission factors; France; National inventory; Volt'Air model","Ammonia; Crops; Nitrogen fertilizers; Surveys; Air models; CADASTRE_NH3; Cultural practices; Emission factors; France; National inventory; Manures; ammonia; nitrogen fertilizer; agricultural emission; ammonia; cadastre; conceptual framework; emission control; emission inventory; estimation method; fertilizer application; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollution; Article; fertilizer application; France; irrigation (agriculture); manure; priority journal; simulation; soil management; soil property; spatiotemporal analysis; volatilization; weather; France; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049781320

Unlike previous contributions, relying on ex-ante simulations, this analysis is based on the actual behaviour of farmers over the period immediately after the last CAP reform. Such ex-post assessment was based on real georeferenced data on farmland allocation, collected in the Lombardy Region, in Northern Italy, over the period 2011-2016. As the current CAP has recently entered in force (in 2015), the present analysis covers the first two years of implementation of the new rules along with the previous four years. Results are in line with previous ex-ante simulations in the same region, detecting a deep discontinuity for those farmland uses characterised by monoculture before the introduction of the greening. They show a significant discontinuity of farmland use transitions in the reference area after the introduction of greening rules, pointing to a decrease in maize monoculture, in favour of other cereals and legume crops like soybean and alfalfa. Unlike some critical opinions that see current greening rules as a “low profile” compromise, the present analysis points to a strong effect of such rules on regions with high-intensity agriculture. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Common Agricultural Policy; crops diversification JEL Q15; farmland use; greening; Markov chains; Q18","agricultural diversification; agricultural land; alfalfa; Common Agricultural Policy; land use; maize; Markov chain; soybean; Italy; Lombardy; Glycine max; Medicago sativa; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053851052

Scenarios are powerful tools to explore possible future changes in agricultural land use, how these may affect the environment, and how policies may influence land-use patterns. Focusing on Argentina's prime agricultural areas, the Pampas, Espinal and Chaco, we developed spatially-explicit future land-use scenarios from 2010 to 2030, considering both agricultural expansion (i.e., conversions from woodland to either grazing land or cropland) and agricultural intensification (i.e., conversions from grazing land to cropland). Our simulations were based on an econometric model of net returns, which assumes economically rational land-use actors. Using this model, we assessed the rates and spatial patterns of future land-use change under current land zoning in our study region, and contrasted this with a forecast of future land use based on land-conversion rates from 2000–2010. We systematically tested the impact of economic policies (e.g., taxes or subsidies), infrastructure improvement (e.g., road paving), and technological innovation (i.e., yield increases) on the spatial patterns of land-use conversions. Our model suggests future land-use change will mainly happen along intensification pathways, with deforestation slowing down, if land-use actors would be profit-maximizing. This general pattern did not change even for policy interventions that impacted profits from agriculture in major ways, cautioning against overestimating the leverage that economic policies provide for halting deforestation. Improving the region's road network would create a strong incentive to expand cropland further into remaining woodlands and over grazing lands. However, low agricultural profits and higher yields could curb deforestation in marginal areas to some extent. We also highlight that priority areas for conservation are particularly likely to experience high land-use pressure in the future. Given the lower-than-expected power of economic policies to alter deforestation patterns in our models, zoning, if properly enforced, appears to be a more straightforward tool for avoiding unwanted environmental impacts in the Chaco. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Chaco; Conservation planning; Deforestation; Economic policies; Espinal; Net returns model; Pampa; Profits; Tropical dry forests; Zoning","agricultural intensification; conservation planning; deforestation; dry forest; econometrics; economic policy; land use change; profitability; zoning system; Argentina; Chaco [Argentina]; Pampas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051113792

The eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain in India, the southeast coast of India Peninsula and the Ayeyarwady Delta in Myanmar have the largest potentials for monsoon rice production. It is necessary for the northeastern and southwestern parts of the Deccan Plateau and the northwestern part of the Indo-Gangetic Plain to improve irrigation equipment to meet the water-use requirements of high-yield rice. The central and southern plains in Myanmar and northeastern India should have greater access to nitrogen fertilization for high-yield rice. © 2018, Science Press.

To support agricultural policies, it is however important to contrast the responses of alternative models, which can differ greatly in their treatment of key processes and in their response to management. We applied eight biogeochemical models at five grassland sites (in France, New Zealand, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States) to compare the sensitivity of modelled C and N fluxes to changes in the density of grazing animals (from 100% to 50% of the original livestock densities), also in combination with decreasing N fertilization levels (reduced to zero from the initial levels). Simulated multi-model median values indicated that input reduction would lead to an increase in the C sink strength (negative net ecosystem C exchange) in intensive grazing systems: −64 ± 74 g C m−2 yr−1 (animal density reduction) and −81 ± 74 g C m−2 yr−1 (N and animal density reduction), against the baseline of −30.5 ± 69.5 g C m−2 yr−1 (LSU [livestock units] ≥ 0.76 ha−1 yr−1). Simulations also indicated a strong effect of N fertilizer reduction on N fluxes, e.g. N2O-N emissions decreased from 0.34 ± 0.22 (baseline) to 0.1 ± 0.05 g N m−2 yr−1 (no N fertilization). Simulated decline in grazing intensity had only limited impact on the N balance. The simulated pattern of enteric methane emissions was dominated by high model-to-model variability. The reduction in simulated offtake (animal intake + cut biomass) led to a doubling in net primary production per animal (increased by 11.6 ± 8.1 t C LSU−1 yr−1 across sites). The highest N2O-N intensities (N2O-N/offtake) were simulated at mown and extensively grazed arid sites. We show the possibility of using grassland models to determine sound mitigation practices while quantifying the uncertainties associated with the simulated outputs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","GHG emission intensity; Livestock density; Nitrogen fertilization; Process-based model; Sensitivity analysis","Agriculture; Animals; Biogeochemistry; Gas emissions; Nitrogen fertilizers; Sensitivity analysis; Agricultural policies; Biogeochemical models; Enteric methane emissions; GHG emission; Livestock density; Net primary production; Nitrogen fertilization; Process-based modeling; Greenhouse gases; methane; nitrogen fertilizer; nitrous oxide; agricultural emission; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; grassland; greenhouse gas; livestock; management practice; nitrogen cycle; sensitivity analysis; air pollution control; Article; biogeochemistry; carbon cycling; carbon footprint; fertilization; France; grassland; grazing; livestock; model; New Zealand; nitrogen cycling; priority journal; simulation; Switzerland; United Kingdom; United States; France; New Zealand; Switzerland; United Kingdom; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048721429

Particularly, surface depressions often alter the releasing patterns of NPS pollutants into the environment. However, most commonly-used hydrologic models may not be applicable to such depression-dominated regions. The objective of this study is to improve water quantity/quality modeling and its calibration for depression-dominated basins under wet and dry hydroclimatic conditions. Specifically, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied for hydrologic and water quality modeling in the Red River of the North Basin (RRB). Surface depressions across the RRB were incorporated into the model by employing a surface delineation method and the impacts of depressions were evaluated for two modeling scenarios, MS1 (basic scenario) and MS2 (depression-oriented scenario). Moreover, a traditional calibration scheme (CS1) was compared to a wet-dry calibration scheme (CS2) that accounted for the effects of hydroclimatic variations on hydrologic and water quality modeling. Results indicated that the surface runoff simulation and the associated water quality modeling were improved when topographic characteristics of depressions were incorporated into the model (MS2). The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient indicated an average increase of 30.4% and 19.6% from CS1 to CS2 for the calibration and validation periods, respectively. Additionally, the CS2 provided acceptable simulations of water quality, with the NSE values of 0.50 and 0.74 for calibration and validation periods, respectively. These results highlight the enhanced capability of the proposed approach for simulating water quantity and quality for depression-dominated basins under the influence of varying hydroclimatic conditions. © 2018 by the authors.

The current study proposes a methodology to evaluate the water footprint (WF) of the irrigated agriculture sector at the river basin level, through a simulation of the anthropised water cycle combining a hydrological model and a decision support system. The main difference from the approaches that have already been used is that the new methodology includes the limitations of the system for the exploitation of water resources where the irrigated areas are located, and it considers the hydrological principles governed by the law of continuity of mass. Water footprint accounting was carried out for the Segura River Basin (South-eastern Spain), applying the methodology proposed and another that is usually applied. The results of the two methodologies were compared, revealing significant differences in the values of the WF, basically due to the blue component. The methodology that is usually applied overestimated the WF of the agriculture in the basin since supply deficits were not taken into account, providing results that would only be possible if there were no spatial or temporal restrictions to water use. So, in order to make the WF indicator useful in water resources management plans, it is necessary to adapt the computations to the main characteristics of the water exploitation system of the whole basin under study, respecting the hydrological principles of the water cycle: regulation and transport infrastructure, the real water resources available and the priority of access to water between concurrent water uses. © 2018 Martínez-Paz et al.

Whereas odour can cause annoyance in the close vicinity of the source, emission of ammonia is a precursor for the formation of particulate matter and acidification on a regional scale. Because of clean air regulation in Europe, total ammonia emissions reduced by 23% between 1990 and 2015 whilst, over the same period, anthropogenic warming became more and more evident. By a simulation of the indoor climate of a confined livestock building with a mechanical ventilation for 1800 fattening pigs, the modification of the odour and ammonia emission was calculated for the period between 1981 and 2017. For ammonia emission, a relative increase of 0.16% per year was determined. But following the clean air endeavour between 1990 and 2015 emissions over that period were reduced by 23%. The global warming signal counteracting this reduction in the range of 4% during over this period, which means that the overall reduction for the ammonia emission was only 19%. For Austria with a global warming increase of 1% from 1990 to 2015, this gives an increase in emissions of 5% instead. Odour emissions also increased by about 0.16% per year. The relative increase of the separation distances for the four cardinal directions was about 0.06% per year, the related increase for the separation area was 0.13% per year. This case study on the fattening pigs shows that the global warming signal has a negligible impact on separation distances. © 2018 The Authors","Airborne emission; Ammonia; Climate change; Livestock; Odour; Pig","Air pollution control; Ammonia; Climate change; Dairies; Global warming; Mammals; Odors; Ventilation; Airborne emissions; Anthropogenic warming; Clean air regulations; Livestock; Mechanical ventilation; Monogastric animals; Odour and ammonia emissions; Separation distances; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053837998

We propose the topic modelling–system dynamics modelling (TM-SDM) analytical framework to extract, synthesise, and dynamically simulate the factors of land management, disaster, pollution, and poverty in the system. Specifically, 1,598 English language publications were collected to analyse the main concerns and conceptual structure of the sustainable development in the case study area based on topic modelling. Historical data from 2000 to 2014 are used for simulation and prediction based on system dynamics modelling, exploring and comparing different policy scenarios. The results show that policies about education and training, sewage treatment, infrastructure construction, and soil erosion control would help poverty reduction significantly. Sewage treatment policy reduces the incidence of human disease and sewage discharge significantly. Education and training policy has the greatest impact on the improvement of poverty reduction and yield of crops, and the environmental protection scenario has the best performance on maintaining the cultivated land. The balanced development scenario benefits both the poverty reduction and environmental protection concurrently. Focussing on a systems approach to improve the sustainability of agriculture, this paper could have a positive impact on the development and implementation of sustainable agricultural systems. The TM-SDM analysis and modelling framework that we proposed has a generic nature, which could be applied to the further research and decision-making on sustainable agriculture and other fields involving complex systems. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","land management; poverty eradication; sustainable agriculture; system dynamics modelling; topic modelling","Agriculture; Data mining; Decision making; Environmental protection; Land use; Modeling languages; Sewage treatment; Soil conservation; System theory; Land managements; Poverty eradication; Sustainable agriculture; System dynamics modelling; Topic modelling; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053759546

The peak years of NO2 columns in 17 provinces occurred in 2011 and 2012. These trends in NO2 columns were determined by the economic developments and enacted air quality policies in nearly all the provinces except for Xizang and Qinghai Provinces, where the trends were determined by natural NOx emission sources. In detail, the panel data analysis showed that the simulated model had fixed effects, and the thermal power generation, consumption of diesel oil in agriculture, passenger traffic by highways, and freight traffic by highways significantly increased NO2, while the air quality policies in the 12th five-year plan decreased NO2 columns from 1997 to 2016. The benefits to decreasing NO2 columns from the air quality policies issued in the 10th and 11th five-year plans were offset by the quickly increasing economies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality policy; China; Economic development; Long-term trend; NO2 column","Air quality; Air quality standards; Diesel fuels; Economics; Traffic surveys; Air quality policy; China; Economic development; Long-term trend; Panel data analysis; Passenger traffic; Seasonal variation; Thermal power generation; Nitrogen oxides; diesel fuel; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; concentration (composition); economic development; long-term change; nitrogen dioxide; nitrous oxide; pollution policy; seasonal variation; agriculture; air pollution; air quality; Article; China; controlled study; data analysis; economic development; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; geographic distribution; highway; nitrous oxide emission; priority journal; rural area; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; simulation; traffic; trend study; air pollutant; analysis; economic development; environmental monitoring; statistics and numerical data; trends; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Economic Development; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047081320

This paper presents a full cost-benefit and environmental analysis of a large regional air quality plan involving several different actions covering a large spectrum of fields, from domestic heating to passenger and freight transport, from electricity generation to agriculture. The impact of each action is analyzed looking at the possible energy savings, greenhouse gases (GHG) emission reductions, the improvement in air quality, and the consequent decrease in external costs, namely the reduced impact on population health. The analysis is performed by applying a flexible and fast computer tool (RIAT+) that allows for a rapid simulation of different pollutant emission scenario, to assess different air quality indices (AQIs) over a regional scale domain. The results show that, in most cases, the economic savings exceed the implementation costs and thus that these actions can be introduced in air quality plans for the domain under study. The reduced health and climate costs, though relevant in absolute terms, are, in general, only a fraction of the economic benefits of energy savings. This is not true for the measures acting on improvements in electricity generation, since a reduction in power plant emissions (generally with high stacks, far from populated areas) does not significantly impact the air quality inside the region. A shift in energy production to renewable sources can instead provide noticeable effects on GHG emissions. This research raises some interesting and general questions about the adequacy of the methodologies applied to attribute costs (and benefits) to actions, improving a variety of sectors that are different from the one in which the measures are applied here. © 2018 by the authors.","Air pollution; Greenhouse gases; Health impacts; Integrated assessment; Secondary pollutants","air quality; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; computer simulation; cost-benefit analysis; energy efficiency; environmental economics; freight transport; greenhouse gas; health impact; heating; integrated approach; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054526909

The simulation results suggest that the land-use choices in the study area reflect a tendency towards increasing subsistence farming in an area where there has been a gradual trend away from traditional land uses such as cereal production to the cultivation of groundnut, rice, maize and soybean. Groundnut monoculture production has emerged locally as coping measure for dealing with increased climatic variability. In terms of livelihood strategy, there is an increasing contribution of rice and groundnut to household gross incomes. The predicted pattern of changes in gross household income under a scenario in which climate change is perceived by local farmers explicitly revealed the contribution of adaptation options to household livelihood strategy. © 2017","Agent-based model; Climate change; Decision making model; Heterogeneous farm households; SKY-LUDAS; Subsistence farming","adaptive management; agricultural labor; agricultural land; agricultural modeling; cereal; climate change; crop production; cultivation; farming system; legume; monoculture; precipitation (climatology); simulation; subsistence agriculture; Ghana; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052924242

An increasing number of companies disclose and evaluate their water footprint, embracing an end-to-end supply chain perspective. In this work, we first propose a strategic system dynamics model for capturing the long-term impact of various water management policies on consumptive water footprint and supply chain profitability under diverse scenarios of consumers' demand patterns depending on blue water-related efficiency (i.e. green market behaviours). We apply the proposed simulation model on a specific wine supply chain and demonstrate that, under specific green market behaviour conditions, technological interventions in agriculture (e.g. drip irrigation) are more environmentally and economically sustainable compared to industrial water recycling and reuse, while the combined application of both policies is even more effective. Additionally, the impact of water-efficient policies on supply chain financial performance is even more potent under increased consumers' environmental sensitivity. Based on the managerial insights obtained from our analysis, as well as current corporate drivers and goals, we finally propose a supporting methodological framework for the ex-ante evaluation of eco-efficient supply chain water management policies, considering the impact of the green market behaviour on water-related and economic sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Green market behaviour; Methodological framework; Supply chain sustainability; System dynamics; Water footprint management","Commerce; Irrigation; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Social aspects; Supply chains; Sustainable development; System theory; Water conservation; Water management; Water recycling; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Economic sustainability; Environmental sensitivities; Green markets; Methodological frameworks; Supply chain financials; System Dynamics; Water footprint; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049112423

Research on the detailed disaggregate driving factors based on provincial carbon emission changes could inform better carbon emission reduction policies. This paper establishes an assessment framework of provincial carbon emissions drivers using system dynamics modelling and makes an empirical analysis of Hebei Province. The model attempts to simulate the dynamic relationship between carbon emissions generation and suppression through seven subsystems including population economy, secondary industry, and policies. In addition, carbon sinks and carbon markets are also incorporated into this framework. Based on the socio-economic conditions, policy guidance and emission reduction targets of Hebei Province, we analyze the impact of single-factor changes and make a four scenario evaluation to explore the mitigation strategies in the light of provincial level. The simulation results are acquired as listed; (1) The impact of technology and energy structure on emission reduction is seen to be obviously, and excessive reliance on carbon emissions trading could not be generated conducive to emission reduction. (2) The combined effectiveness of driving factors is not equal to the aggregation of simple summation of each single factor. (3) The role of carbon sinks in reducing emissions should not be ignored. Therefore, the results of empirical analysis show that targeted emission reduction measures should be formulated according to the actual carbon emission sources.

However, lack of studies to assess health risk associated with such practices has hindered their popularity. A Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment was conducted to estimate the public health risks for two greywater reuse scenarios: toilet flushing and food-crop irrigation. Household greywater quality from three sources (bathroom, laundry and kitchen) was analyzed. Mathematical exposure rates of different scenarios were established based on human behavior using Monte-Carlo simulation. The results showed that, greywater from all three household sources could be safely used for toilet flushing after a simple treatment of microfiltration. The median range of annual infection risk was 8.8 × 10−15–8.3 × 10−11 per-person-per-year (pppy); and the median range of disease burden was 7.6 × 10−19–7.3 × 10−15 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) pppy. In food-crop irrigation scenario, the annual infection risks and disease burdens of treated greywater from bathroom and laundry (2.8 × 10−8, 4.9 × 10−8 pppy; 2.3 × 10−12–4.2 × 10−12 DALYs pppy) were within the acceptable levels of U.S. EPA annual infection risk (≤10−4 pppy) and WHO disease burden (≤10−6 DALYs pppy) benchmarks, while kitchen greywater was not suitable for food-crop irrigation (4.9 × 10−6 pppy; 4.3 × 10−10 DALYs pppy) based on these benchmarks. The model uncertainties were discussed, which suggests that a more accurate risk estimation requires improvements on data collection and model refinement. © 2018 The Authors","Annual infection risk; Disease burden; Monte Carlo simulation; Pathogenic E. coli; QMRA","Behavioral research; Cleaning; Crops; Escherichia coli; Estimation; Intelligent systems; Irrigation; Microfiltration; Monte Carlo methods; Potable water; Public risks; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Uncertainty analysis; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Disability adjusted life years; Disease burdens; Model uncertainties; Pathogenic E. coli; QMRA; Quantitative microbial risk assessment; Simple treatments; Wastewater treatment plants; Health risks; greywater; unclassified drug; water; computer simulation; Monte Carlo analysis; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; wastewater treatment; Article; Clostridia; controlled study; disability-adjusted life year; disease burden; Enterovirus; Escherichia coli; Giardia; infection risk; irrigation (agriculture); mathematical analysis; measurement accuracy; microfiltration; Monte Carlo method; nonhuman; Norovirus; priority journal; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; Rotavirus; Salmonella; sanitation; Staphylococcus aureus; microbiology; procedures; recycling; risk assessment; sewage; waste water; Recycling; Risk Assessment; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046159037

Capturing these interactions, and quantifying their importance, offers important insights into effective interventions. In this study, we capture high time-resolution activity data for twenty-five Vietnamese farmers during collection and land application of human excreta for agriculture. Although human excreta use improves productivity, the use increases risks of enteric infections for both farmers and end users. In our study, the activity data are integrated with environmental microbial sampling data into a stochastic-mechanistic simulation of E. coli contamination on hands and E. coli ingested. Results from the study include frequent and variable contact rates for farmers’ hands (from 34 to 1344 objects contacted per hour per hand), including highly variable hand-to-mouth contact rates (from 0 to 9 contacts per hour per hand). The frequency of hand-to-mouth contacts was substantially lower than the widely-used frequency previously reported for U.S. Office Workers. Environmental microbial contamination data highlighted ubiquitous E. coli contamination in the environment, including excreta, hands, toilet pit, handheld tools, soils, surfaces, and water. Results from the simulation suggest dynamic changes in E. coli contamination on hands, and wide variation in hand contamination and E. coli ingested amongst the farmers studied. Sensitivity analysis suggests that E. coli contamination on hands and ingested doses are most influenced by contamination of handheld tools, excreta, and the toilet pit as well as by frequency of hand-to-mouth contacts. The study findings are especially relevant given the context: no farmers reported adequate storage time of human excreta, and personal protective mask availability did not prevent hand-to-mouth contacts. Integrating high time-resolution activity data into exposure assessments highlights variation in exposures amongst farmers, and offers greater insight into effective interventions and their potential impacts. © 2018 The Authors","Human excreta; Land application; Microlevel activity time series; Quantitative microbial risk assessment","Agriculture; Contamination; Digital storage; Diseases; Escherichia coli; Office buildings; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic systems; Activity time; Exposure assessment; High-time resolution; Human excreta; Infectious disease; Land applications; Microbial contamination; Quantitative microbial risk assessment; Water pollution; assessment method; coliform bacterium; disease transmission; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; simulation; time series analysis; adult; agricultural procedures; agricultural worker; Article; bacterium contamination; body fluids and secretions; cohort analysis; controlled study; data processing; environmental microbiology; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli infection; female; hand; human; infection risk; intestine infection; male; mouth; nonhuman; occupational exposure; occupational hazard; priority journal; productivity; sampling; simulation; soil microflora; stochastic model; surface property; Vietnamese; water contamination; agriculture; Escherichia coli; feces; hand; isolation and purification; microbiology; middle aged; procedures; statistics and numerical data; Viet Nam; Viet Nam; fertilizer; Adult; Agriculture; Escherichia coli; Farmers; Feces; Female; Fertilizers; Hand; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Vietnam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045443797

The three-fold scheme was implemented step by step: (1) optimizing short-term (daily scale) reservoir operation for maximizing hydropower output and final reservoir storage during typhoon seasons; (2) simulating long-term (ten-day scale) water shortage rates in consideration of the availability of irrigation ponds for both agricultural and public sectors during non-typhoon seasons; and (3) promoting the synergistic benefits of the WFE Nexus in a year-round perspective by integrating the short-term optimization and long-term simulation of reservoir operations. The pivotal Shihmen Reservoir and 745 irrigation ponds located in Taoyuan City of Taiwan together with the surrounding urban areas formed the study case. The results indicated that the optimal short-term reservoir operation obtained from the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) could largely increase hydropower output but just slightly affected water supply. The simulation results of the reservoir coupled with irrigation ponds indicated that such joint operation could significantly reduce agricultural and public water shortage rates by 22.2% and 23.7% in average, respectively, as compared to those of reservoir operation excluding irrigation ponds. The results of year-round short/long-term joint operation showed that water shortage rates could be reduced by 10% at most, the food production rate could be increased by up to 47%, and the hydropower benefit could increase up to 9.33 million USD per year, respectively, in a wet year. Consequently, the proposed methodology could be a viable approach to promoting the synergistic benefits of the WFE Nexus, and the results provided unique insights for stakeholders and policymakers to pursue sustainable urban development plans. © 2018","Artificial intelligence (AI); Multi-objective optimization; NSGA-II; Synergistic benefits; Water-Food-Energy Nexus","Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Hurricanes; Hydroelectric power; Irrigation; Lakes; Multiobjective optimization; Ponds; Urban growth; Water supply; Long term simulation; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); NSGA-II; Reservoir operation; Reservoir optimizations; Shih-Men reservoir; Sustainable urban development; Synergistic benefits; Reservoirs (water); artificial intelligence; food security; genetic algorithm; hydroelectric power; irrigation system; optimization; water management; water supply; Article; controlled study; environmental parameters; environmental policy; hydropower; irrigation (agriculture); multi objective reservoir optimization; pond; priority journal; process optimization; reliability; seasonal variation; simulation; Taiwan; urbanization; Water Food Energy Nexus; water supply; Shihmen Reservoir; Taiwan; Taoyuan [Taiwan]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044167012

The aim of this paper was to study the microbial fate and transport in an agricultural catchment and recipient water source through further development of the hydrological model HYPE. Hydrological modelling was combined with hydrodynamic modelling to simulate the fate and transport of Salmonella spp., verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 (VTEC) and Cryptosporidium parvum in an agricultural catchment of a drinking water source, Lake Vombsjön, in Sweden. This approach was useful to study the influence of different processes on the pathogen fate and transport, and to interpret the relative changes in the simulated concentrations. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the largest uncertainties in the model were associated with the estimation of pathogen loads, parameterisation of the pathogen processes, and simulation of partitioning between surface runoff and infiltration. The proposed modelling approach is valuable for assessing the relative effect of different risk-reducing interventions. © IWA Publishing 2018.","Hydrodynamic modelling; Hydrological modelling; Pathogens; Salmonella; VTEC; | C. parvum","drinking water; surface water; agricultural catchment; arable land; concentration (composition); environmental fate; human activity; hydrological modeling; manure; microbial activity; pasture; pathogen; pollutant transport; risk assessment; water quality; arable land; Article; catchment; compartment model; concentration (parameters); controlled study; Cryptosporidium parvum; environmental impact; evapotranspiration; fluid intake; grazing; hydrodynamics; hydrology; infectious agent; lake; manure; microbial contamination; nonhuman; pasture; pathogen load; risk; risk reduction; runoff; sedimentation rate; surface area; Sweden; turnover time; water quality; water supply; agriculture; animal; bacterium; bovine; classification; computer simulation; environmental monitoring; feces; human; microbiology; prevention and control; theoretical model; water pollutant; water pollution; Sweden; Animalia; Cryptosporidium parvum; Escherichia coli; Salmonella; Agriculture; Animals; Bacteria; Cattle; Computer Simulation; Environmental Monitoring; Feces; Humans; Lakes; Models, Theoretical; Sweden; Water Microbiology; Water Pollutants; Water Pollution; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054432467

The UN projects a human population of approximately 11 billion by the end of the 21st century; requiring additional agricultural land, greater demands for natural resources, and technological advancements. We model human population over the next century, emphasizing feedbacks between natural and agricultural resource availability and human demography. We argue that an intensive agriculture approach to feeding the growing population is ill-conceived, without considering biodiversity and ecosystem services (e.g., nutrient cycling, pollination, water purification, pest control). The productivity of agricultural land and human population dynamics are dependent on the area of natural land—generally, tipping at 5 billion ha of natural land (approximately 40% of the Earth’s terrestrial area). Furthermore, our model shows that an imprudent proactive approach (i.e., focusing on agriculture and ignoring ecosystem services) limits the success of reactive measures (i.e., restoration) in the future, while the inability to react to changes and recover natural systems leads to human population decline. © 2018 Henderson, Loreau. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",,"agricultural land; article; biodiversity; demography; ecosystem; feeding; human; natural resource; nutrient cycling; pest control; pollination; population dynamics; productivity; water management; agriculture; astronomy; catering service; computer simulation; ecology; environment; environmental protection; forecasting; population growth; procedures; statistics and numerical data; sustainable growth; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Demography; Earth (Planet); Ecology; Ecosystem; Environment; Food Supply; Forecasting; Humans; Population Dynamics; Population Growth; Sustainable Growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053074599

Besides temperature and the amount and timing of precipitation, grass production is also highly controlled by applications of nitrogen fertilizers and land management to sustain a high productivity. Since management characteristics of pastures vary greatly across Europe, land-use intensity and their projections are critical input variables in earth system modeling when examining and predicting the effects of increasingly intensified agricultural and livestock systems on the environment. In this study, we aim to improve the representation of pastures in the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. This is done by incorporating daily carbon allocation for grasses as a foundation to further implement daily land management routines and land-use intensity data into the model to discriminate between intensively and extensively used regions. We further compare our new simulations with leaf area index observations, reported regional grassland productivity, and simulations conducted with the vegetation model ORCHIDEE-GM. Additionally, we analyze the implications of including pasture fertilization and daily management compared to the standard version of LPJ-GUESS. Our results demonstrate that grassland productivity cannot be adequately captured without including land-use intensity data in form of nitrogen applications. Using this type of information improved spatial patterns of grassland productivity significantly compared to standard LPJ-GUESS. In general, simulations for net primary productivity, net ecosystem carbon balance and nitrogen leaching were considerably increased in the extended version. Finally, the adapted version of LPJ-GUESS, driven with projections of climate and land-use intensity, simulated an increase in potential grassland productivity until 2050 for several agro-climatic regions, most notably for the Mediterranean North, the Mediterranean South, the Atlantic Central and the Atlantic South. © 2018 Blanke et al.

In this situation, priority setting has become increasingly important for allocating scarce research resources among competing needs to achieve greater impacts. Using partial equilibrium economic surplus models and poverty impact simulations, this paper assesses cassava research priorities in Africa, Latin America and Caribbean, and Asia based on the potential economic and poverty reduction impacts of alternative research and technology options. The results showed that efficient planting material production and distribution systems and sustainable crop and soil fertility management practices have the greatest expected economic and poverty reduction impacts in the three regions. Lack of clean planting materials is a major constraint to adoption and it is envisaged that efficient production and distribution systems for planting material can accelerate technology adoption by farmers. Similarly, sustainable crop and soil fertility management practices play a key role in closing the observed yield gaps, especially in Africa.

To that end, RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) was implemented at the Upper Acheloos River catchment, Western Central Greece, annually and multi-annually for the period 1965–92. The model estimates soil erosion as the linear product of six factors (R, K, LS, C, and P) considering the catchment’s climatic, pedological, topographic, land cover, and anthropogenic characteristics, respectively. The C factor was estimated using six alternative land use delineations of different resolution, namely the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) project (2000, 2012 versions) (1:100,000), a land use map conducted by the Greek National Agricultural Research Foundation (NAGREF) (1:20,000), a land use map conducted by the Greek Payment and Control Agency for Guidance and Guarantee Community Aid (PCAGGCA) (1:5,000), and the Landsat 8 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset (30 m/pixel) (two approximations) based on remote sensing data (satellite image acquired on 07/09/2016) (1:40,000). Since all other factors remain unchanged per each RUSLE application, the differences among the yielded results are attributed to the C factor (thus the land cover pattern) variations. Validation was made considering the convergence between simulated (modeled) and observed sediment yield. The latter was estimated based on field measurements conducted by the Greek PPC (Public Power Corporation). The model performed best at both time scales using the Landsat 8 (Eq. 13) dataset, characterized by a detailed resolution and a satisfactory categorization, allowing the identification of the most susceptible to erosion areas. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Acheloos River; C factor; Erosion; Land cover; NDVI; RUSLE","Catchments; Land use; Remote sensing; Runoff; Sediment transport; Soils; Anthropogenic characteristics; C factors; Land cover; NDVI; Normalized difference vegetation index; Public power corporations; Revised universal soil loss equations; RUSLE; Erosion; catchment; environmental assessment; factor analysis; land cover; Landsat; NDVI; pixel; remote sensing; Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation; satellite data; satellite imagery; soil erosion; article; human; land use; river; satellite imagery; sediment; simulation; soil erosion; validation process; vegetation; chemistry; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; Greece; irrigation (agriculture); plant development; procedures; river; soil; standards; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; water supply; Acheloos River; Greece; Agricultural Irrigation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Greece; Models, Theoretical; Plant Development; Rivers; Satellite Imagery; Soil; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049751198

Predators are often perceived as competitors or threats to human values or well-being. This conflict has persisted for centuries, often resulting in predator removal (i.e. killing) via targeted culling, trapping, poisoning, and/or public hunts. Predator removal persists as a management strategy but requires scientific evaluation to assess the impacts of these actions, and to develop a way forward in a world where human-predator conflict may intensify due to predator reintroduction and rewilding, alongside an expanding human population. We reviewed literature investigating predator removal and focused on identifying instances of successes and failures. We found that predator removal was generally intended to protect domestic animals from depredation, to preserve prey species, or to mitigate risks of direct human conflict, corresponding to being conducted in farmland, wild land, or urban areas. Because of the different motivations for predator removal, there was no consistent definition of what success entailed so we developed one with which to assess studies we reviewed. Research tended to be retrospective and correlative and there were few controlled experimental approaches that evaluated whether predator removal met our definition of success, making formal meta-analysis impossible. Predator removal appeared to only be effective for the short-term, failing in the absence of sustained predator suppression. This means predator removal was typically an ineffective and costly approach to conflicts between humans and predators. Management must consider the role of the predator within the ecosystem and the potential consequences of removal on competitors and prey. Simulations or models can be generated to predict responses prior to removing predators. We also suggest that alternatives to predator removal be further developed and researched. Ultimately, humans must coexist with predators and learning how best to do so may resolve many conflicts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Conservation and wildlife management; Fisheries and agriculture; Human-wildlife conflict; Predator-prey interactions; Rewilding; Trophic cascade","Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048729527

Although they have been widely adopted, insufficient data exist to understand their short and long-term effectiveness. High inter-event variability in performance has been observed, yet the majority of studies report average removal efficiencies over observed or simulated events, ignoring the disproportional effects of loads into and out of VFSs over longer periods of time. We argue that due to positively correlated sediment concentration-discharge relationships, disproportional contribution of runoff events transporting sediment over the course of a year (i.e., temporal inequality), decreased performance with increasing flow rates, and effects of antecedent moisture condition, VFS removal efficiencies over annual time scales may be significantly lower than reported per-event averages. By applying a stochastic approach, we investigated the extent of disparity between reporting average efficiencies from each runoff event over the course of 1 year versus the total annual load reduction. Additionally, we examined the effects of soil texture, concentration-discharge relationship, and VFS slope in contributing to this disparity, with the goal of revealing potential errors that may be incurred by ignoring the effects of temporal inequality in quantifying VFS performance. Simulation results suggest that ignoring temporal inequality can lead to overestimation of annual performance by as little as < 2% and to as much as > 20%, with the greatest disparities observed for soils with high clay content. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agricultural runoff; Average annual efficiency; BMPs; Sediment; Vegetated filter strips; Water quality","Agriculture; Bacteriology; Bandpass filters; Efficiency; Sediments; Stochastic systems; Water quality; Antecedent moisture; Average efficiencies; Best management practices; BMPs; Removal efficiencies; Sediment concentration; Stochastic approach; Vegetated filter strips; Agricultural runoff; runoff; sediment transport; sediment trap; water quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040055598

Therefore, efficiency has to be increased, and the regulation and control flow should be implemented. Hydraulic modelling represents a strategic tool for the reconstruction of the missing hydraulic data. This paper proposes a methodology for the unmeasured offtake and flowing discharge estimation along the open-canal Canale Emiliano Romagnolo (CER), which is one of the major irrigation infrastructures in Northern Italy. The ""multi-disciplinary approach"" that was adopted refers to agronomic and hydraulic aspects. The tools that were used are the IRRINET management Decisional Support System (DSS) and the SIC2 (Simulation and Integration of Control for Canals) hydraulic software. Firstly, the methodology was developed and tested on a Pilot Segment (PS), characterized by a simple geometry and a quite significant historical hydraulic data availability. Then, it was applied on an Extended Segment (ES) of a more complex geometry and hydraulic functioning. Moreover, the available hydraulic data are scarce. The combination of these aspects represents a crucial issue in the irrigation networks in general. © 2018 by the authors.","Hydraulic modelling; Irrigation DSS; Lined irrigation open-canal; Unmeasured discharges estimation","Climate change; Computer software; Decision support systems; Hydraulic models; Hydraulic structures; Hydraulic tools; Irrigation; Complex geometries; Data availability; Discharge estimation; Irrigation Networks; Irrigation waters; Multi-disciplinary approach; Regulation and control; Simple geometries; Irrigation canals; canal; climate change; decision support system; discharge; estimation method; flow regulation; hydrological modeling; infrastructure; mitigation; reconstruction; water management; water storage; water use; Emilia-Romagna; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051118587

The associated disease burden and optimal mitigation strategies remain unknown. We sought to understand where and to what extent increasing carbon dioxide concentrations may increase the global burden of nutritional deficiencies through changes in crop nutrient concentrations, and the effects of potential mitigation strategies. Methods and findings: For each of 137 countries, we incorporated estimates of climate change, crop nutrient concentrations, dietary patterns, and disease risk into a microsimulation model of zinc and iron deficiency. These estimates were obtained from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, US Department of Agriculture, Statistics Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and Global Burden of Disease Project, respectively. In the absence of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, we estimated that zinc and iron deficiencies would induce 1,072.9 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally over the period 2015 to 2050 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 971.1–1,167.7). In the presence of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, we estimated that decreasing zinc and iron concentrations of crops would induce an additional 125.8 million DALYs globally over the same period (95% CrI: 113.6–138.9). This carbon-dioxide-induced disease burden is projected to disproportionately affect nations in the World Health Organization’s South-East Asia and African Regions (44.0 and 28.5 million DALYs, respectively), which already have high existing disease burdens from zinc and iron deficiencies (364.3 and 299.5 million DALYs, respectively), increasing global nutritional inequalities. A climate mitigation strategy such as the Paris Agreement (an international agreement to keep global temperatures within 2°C of pre-industrial levels) would be expected to avert 48.2% of this burden (95% CrI: 47.8%–48.5%), while traditional public health interventions including nutrient supplementation and disease control programs would be expected to avert 26.6% of the burden (95% CrI: 23.8%–29.6%). Of the traditional public health interventions, zinc supplementation would be expected to avert 5.5%, iron supplementation 15.7%, malaria mitigation 3.2%, pneumonia mitigation 1.6%, and diarrhea mitigation 0.5%. The primary limitations of the analysis include uncertainty regarding how food consumption patterns may change with climate, how disease mortality rates will change over time, and how crop zinc and iron concentrations will decline from those at present to those in 2050. Conclusions: Effects of increased carbon dioxide on crop nutrient concentrations are anticipated to exacerbate inequalities in zinc and iron deficiencies by 2050. Proposed Paris Agreement strategies are expected to be more effective than traditional public health measures to avert the increased inequality. © 2018 Weyant et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; iron; zinc; anemia; Article; carbondioxide induced nutritional deficiency; climate change; comparative effectiveness; crop production; diarrhea; disability-adjusted life year; disease burden; disease control; disease exacerbation; health care availability; health care policy; human; iron deficiency; iron deficiency anemia; iron therapy; malaria; microsimulation; nonhuman; nutrient supply; nutritional deficiency; outcome assessment; pneumonia; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; risk factor; simulation; zinc deficiency; atmosphere; catering service; comorbidity; computer simulation; crop; deficiency; disability; environmental monitoring; feeding behavior; global health; growth, development and aging; metabolism; nutritional deficiency; nutritional status; nutritional value; risk assessment; time factor; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Comorbidity; Computer Simulation; Crops, Agricultural; Deficiency Diseases; Disability Evaluation; Environmental Monitoring; Feeding Behavior; Food Supply; Global Health; Humans; Iron; Nutritional Status; Nutritive Value; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Zinc",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051127139

A set of water and wastewater allocation scenarios are proposed for water quantity and quality management of the study area, while six main stakeholders with conflicting utilities and different negotiation powers are involved. The proposed methodology is applied to Tehran metropolitan area, the capital city of Iran with the population of about 8 million people, to examine its applicability and effectiveness. The results shows that using fuzzy multi-stakeholder multi-criteria decision making method considering equal and different negotiation powers can lead to different outcomes. Based on the results, the MFSC method, which considers a number of decision makers having different negotiation powers, degrees of importance of decision making criteria, and some important uncertainties, performs more promising in real water resources management problems. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Fuzzy logic; Multi-stakeholder multi-criteria methodology; Social choice; Water allocation and reuse","Aquifers; Behavioral research; Decision theory; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Hydrogeology; Quality management; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water resources; Decision making criteria; Decision making process; Multi-criteria; Multi-criteria decision making methods; Social choice; Wastewater treatment plants; Water allocations; Water resources management; Decision making; ground water; water; agricultural land; aquifer; decision making; fuzzy mathematics; metropolitan area; multicriteria analysis; planning method; recharge; resource allocation; stakeholder; wastewater treatment plant; water management; water resource; water use; agricultural land; aquifer; Article; city; controlled study; effluent; fuzzy logic; intermethod comparison; Iran; runoff; simulation; urban area; waste water treatment plant; water quality; water supply; water table; agriculture; analysis; city; decision making; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; fuzzy logic; procedures; statistics and numerical data; supply and distribution; uncertainty; waste water; water supply; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Tehran [Tehran (PRV)]; Agriculture; Choice Behavior; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Decision Making; Environmental Monitoring; Fuzzy Logic; Iran; Uncertainty; Waste Water; Water; Water Resources; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049325248

Compliance can be improved by allowing landholders to meet legal reserve requirements by buying and selling the rights to have deforested land through a Tradeable Development Rights system (TDR). While this policy mechanism may prevent native habitat area loss, the spatial pattern of reserved areas will shift, creating novel landscape patterns. The resulting altered fragmentation and connectivity of habitat will impact biodiversity. TDR may also allow landholders to earn rent on land they never intended on converting, resulting in additional deforestation elsewhere and net habitat loss. We construct a simulation model to explore the potential implications for biodiversity when development rights can be traded, compared with the landscape resulting from enforced individual compliance with deforestation laws. We find that where future deforestation is very likely, a TDR market can provide better outcomes for both biodiversity and agriculture, resulting in more connected habitat networks with larger fragments and fewer edge effects. However, the TDR market can be harmful if future deforestation is unlikely, or if one habitat type is tightly spatially correlated with high economic returns from agriculture. Policy implications. Allowing landholders to buy and sell the rights to keep more cleared land than legally stipulated will result in transformed multiuse landscapes. Losses of native habitat in some areas will be offset in others. We conclude that trading forest development rights has the potential to improve habitat configurations, but that careful consideration should be given to current species distributions and likely future deforestation scenarios. © 2018 The Authors.

Bhutan has embraced the ambitious goal of becoming the world's first 100% organic nation. By analysing recent on-farm data in Bhutan, we found organic crop yields on average to be 24% lower than conventional yields. Based on these yield gaps, we assess the effects of the 100% organic conversion policy by employing an economy-wide computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with detailed representation of Bhutan's agricultural sector incorporating agroecological zones, crop nutrients, and field operations. Despite a low dependency on agrochemicals from the onset of this initiative, we find a considerable reduction in Bhutan's GDP, substantial welfare losses, particularly for non-Agricultural households, and adverse impacts on food security. The yield gap is the main driver for a strong decline in domestic agricultural production, which is largely compensated by increased food imports, resulting in a weakening of the country's cereal self-sufficiency. Current organic by default farming practices in Bhutan are still underdeveloped and do not apply the systems approach of organic farming as defined in the IFOAM organic farming standards. This is reflected in the strong decline of nitrogen (N) availability to crops in our simulation and bears potential for increased yields in OA. Improvement of soil-fertility practices, e.g., the adoption of N-fixing crops, improved animal husbandry systems with increased provision of animal manure and access to markets with price premium for organic products could help to lower the economic cost of the large-scale conversion. © 2018 Feuerbacher et al.

Incorporation of these analyses into current regulatory methods for occupational pesticide exposure is enabled by the exposure data sets and associated data currently used in the risk assessment approach of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Monte Carlo simulations were performed on exposure measurements from the Agricultural Handler Exposure Database and the Pesticide Handler Exposure Database along with data from the Exposure Factors Handbook and other sources to calculate exposure rates for three different neurotoxic compounds (azinphos methyl, acetamiprid, emamectin benzoate) across four pesticide-handling scenarios. Probabilistic estimates of doses were compared with the no observable effect levels used in the EPA occupational risk assessments. Some percentage of workers were predicted to exceed the level of concern for all three compounds: 54% for azinphos methyl, 5% for acetamiprid, and 20% for emamectin benzoate.

Firstly, ecosystem services that were perceived as important by the stakeholders were identified, namely food, fodder, energy, construction materials, marketable products, water provision, and erosion control. Quantitative indicators were then determined to analyze the capacity of land use types to supply the ecosystem services. Land use scenarios were developed based on their applicability and capacity to mitigate climate change impacts. The perception of stakeholders was applied to evaluate changes in ecosystem services provision by the scenarios. A modeling approach for a spatially explicit simulation was used to assess the potential to provide ecosystem services at a district level. The results reflected the different trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services of each scenario, depending on the district. Along with the local perception, characteristics of land use patterns also influenced the regional potential of ecosystem services provision. © 2018 by the authors.","Agriculture; Climate change impact; Land use change; Modeling; Participation; Planning; Stakeholder; Synergy; Trade-off; Transdisciplinarity; West Africa",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047860978

Simultaneously, a new factor decomposition model for irrigation water demand was created using the extended Kaya identity. Moreover, the additive and multiplicative forms of the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition were used to quantify the variation of driving factors in irrigation water demand from 1985 to 2014. The results show that total irrigation water demand in this arid region had increased by 3.249 × 108 m3 over the past 30 years. These contributions are arising from the following four driving factors - planting scale, planting pattern, climate change and water saving technology (e.g., drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, etc.) with respective contribution of irrigation water demand of 1.981 × 108 m3, 0.933 × 108 m3, 1.523 × 108 m3 and −1.188 × 108 m3. The corresponding average contribution rates of these driving factors are 60.96%, 28.72%, 46.86% and −36.53%, respectively. Although the effects of the four drivers on the irrigation water demand for various crops over three periods (i.e., 1985–1994; 1995–2004; 2005–2014) are inconsistent, both the planting scale and the cropping pattern increase the irrigation water demand. Water saving technologies as known have inhibited water demand, but climate change turns out to increase the demand and then inhibit it. Therefore, to reduce the irrigation water demand and develop a proper irrigation water planning in Heihe River basin, it is beneficial to regulate the scale of agricultural development, adjust the agriculture pattern by reducing the area planted with crops that consume relatively large amounts of water (i.e. spring corn and vegetables), identify agricultural water saving potential and decrease the impact of climate change. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Arid region; Driving factor effects; Irrigation water demand; LMDI factor decomposition; SWAT model","Arid regions; Climate change; Crops; Economics; Rain; Sprinkler systems (irrigation); Water; Water conservation; Watersheds; Agricultural development; Driving factors; Factor decompositions; Hydrological response unit; Irrigation waters; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT model; Water saving technology; Water resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046030049

The objective of this paper is to evaluate the impacts of aerosol direct effects on air quality over the southern Hebei cities, as well as the impacts when considering those effects on source apportionment using three dimensional air quality models. The WRF/Chem model was applied over the East Asia and northern China at 36 and 12 km horizontal grid resolutions, respectively, for the period of January 2013, with two sets of simulations with or without aerosol-meteorology feedbacks. The source contributions of power plants, industrial, domestic, transportation, and agriculture are evaluated using the Brute-Force Method (BFM) under the two simulation configurations. Our results indicate that, although the increases in PM2.5 concentrations due to those effects over the three southern Hebei cities are only 3%–9% on monthly average, they are much more significant under high PM2.5 loadings (~50 μg·m–3 when PM2.5 concentrations are higher than 400 μg·m–3). When considering the aerosol feedbacks, the contributions of industrial and domestic sources assessed using the BFM will obviously increase (e.g., from 30%–34% to 32%–37% for industrial), especially under high PM2.5 loadings (e.g., from 36%–44% to 43%–47% for domestic when PM2.5&gt;400 μg·m–3). Our results imply that the aerosol direct effects should not be ignored during severe pollution episodes, especially in short-term source apportionment using the BFM.

Providing robust and actionable climate information at regional scales relies on the downscaling of global climate model data and its translation into impact-relevant information. The New South Wales/Australian Capital Territory Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) project contains downscaled climate data over all of Australia at a 50 km resolution, with ensembles of simulations for the recent past (1990–2009), near future (2020–2039) and far future (2060–2079). Here we calculate and examine sector-relevant indices of climate extremes recommended by the Expert Team on Sector-specific Climate Indices (ET-SCI). We demonstrate the utility of NARCliM and the ET-SCI indices in understanding how future changes in climate extremes could impact aspects of the health and agricultural sectors in Australia. Consistent with previous climate projections, our results indicate that increases in heat and drought related extremes throughout the 21st century will occur. In the far future, maximum day time temperatures are projected to increase by up to 3.5 °C depending on season and location. The number of heatwaves and the duration of the most intense heatwaves will increase significantly in the near and far future, with greater increases in the north than south. All capital cities are projected to experience at least a tripling of heatwave days each year by the far future, compared to the recent past. Applying published heat-health relationships to projected changes in temperature shows that increases in mortality due to high temperatures for all cities examined would occur if projected future climates occurred today. Drought and the number of days above 30 °C are also projected to increase over the major wheat-growing regions of the country, particularly during spring when sensitivity of wheat to heat stress is greatest. Assuming no adaptation or acclimatisation, published statistical relationships between drought and national wheat yield suggest that national yields will have a less than one quarter chance of exceeding the annual historical average under far future precipitation change (excluding impacts of future temperature change and CO2 fertilization). The NARCliM data examined here, along with the ET-SCI indices calculated, provide a powerful and publicly available dataset for regional planning against future changes in climate extremes. © 2018 The Authors","Agriculture; Australia; Climate extremes; Climate impacts; Health","Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045004931

It is the responsibility of scientists to work with other actors to co-construct strategies that will lead to sustainable land-use policies. Using chipped pruned branches (CPB) as mulch can be a viable option because they represent local (in situ) organic material that can restore soil nutrients and organic matter. This research assesses: i) the perception of farmers towards different types of management strategies and CPB's costs; ii) the biomass yield of citrus branches and the impact of CPB on soil properties; iii) how CPB affects soil erosion and runoff generation in citrus plantations; and, iv) a discussion about how to favour the use of CPB thought successful policies. To achieve those goals we carried out: i) one-hundred interviews to assess the perception of farmers and twelve interviews to assess the economic balance of twelve land owners; ii) soil was sampled at 0–2 and 4–6 cm depths; iii) pruned material was surveyed for 40 trees; and iv) forty rainfall simulation experiments (55 mm h−1) were carried out in two citrus plantations at paired sites (Control versus CPB), in La Costera District in Eastern Spain. Forty circular (0.25 m2) plots were installed in four rows (4 × 5 = 20 plots) in control (CON) and CPB plots (20 + 20 = 40 plots) to perform the rainfall simulations over one hour. The cost of chipping ranged from 102 to 253 € ha−1, and was related to the size of the farm. The soil quality, runoff and erosion assessment showed that CPB is a suitable strategy. CPB increased organic matter from 1.3% to 2.9% after 10 years in the 0–2 cm depth layer, while the 4–6 cm layer was largely not affected (OM moved from 1.1 to 1.3% after 10 years), and soil bulk density showed a similar trend: a decrease from 1.36 to 1.16 g cm−3 in the surface layer with no change in the subsurface layer. The hydrological and erosional responses were different between CON and CPB. The CON plots initiated ponding (40 s) and runoff (107 s) earlier than the CPB plots (169 and 254 s, respectively); and runoff discharge was 60% in CON vs 43% in CPB plots. Sediment concentration was four times larger in the CON plots than in the CPB (11.3 g l−1 vs 3 g l−1), and soil erosion was 3.8 Mg ha−1 h-1 vs 0.7 Mg ha−1 h−1. CPB mulches were effective at controlling soil and water losses in Mediterranean citrus plantations as they showed the relationship between vegetation/litter cover and soil erosion rates. However, the farmer's perception survey showed that the use of CPB was not welcomed nor accepted by the farmers. Policies that aim to promote CPB as soil conservation mulch need to be promoted by subsidies as the farmers requested, and by education to demonstrate the positive effects of CPB to of the farming community. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Citrus; Erosion; Mediterranean; Mulches; Runoff; Soil","agricultural land; land management; land use change; plantation; policy approach; rainfall; runoff; soil erosion; sustainability; Spain; Citrus; Costera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044007629

The Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) provides for the protection of water bodies that represent pristine or near-pristine condition, classified as high ecological status through the adoption of an agri-environmental decision making process that promotes stakeholder participation. However, successful implementation of agri-environmental policies can prove challenging when faced with uncertainties and diverging opinions due to the variety of actors involved. This study adopted a participatory approach including stakeholders with conflicting interests in the selection of P transfer mitigation policies. Fifteen P transfer mitigation options were shortlisted based on agronomic and environmental data from a case-study agricultural catchment and presented to a group of experts and farmers. Results showed significant disparities between perceived effectiveness by farmers and experts groups, with experts prioritizing problems related to connectivity issues, while farmers to soil compaction and erosion. In addition, measured agronomic and environmental variables were used to model effectiveness from a decision support tool (FARMSCOPER) and compared with stakeholder groups’ perceived effectiveness. This approach combined the scientific research with the empirical knowledge of farmers and the modelling of quantified field and farm data. This study showed that stakeholders are diverse, and perceive effectiveness based on group-specific operational and social factors. Experts identified effectiveness at catchment scale, whilst farmers identified field scale effectiveness. For decision support tools and simulation models to be beneficial for policy makers, they need to be calibrated to local conditions and farm typologies to select the right measure at farm scale. The study recommends improved knowledge transfer between interested actors and the need for integration of conflicting opinions in policy design. A bottom-up approach to decision making is suggested, to assist in the decentralization of the procedures towards more effectively implemented P transfer mitigation policies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; High status river bodies; Participatory methods; Phosphorus; Policy design","agricultural worker; Article; catchment; decentralization; decision support system; environmental decision making; environmental policy; fertilizer application; human; Ireland; priority journal; program effectiveness; river; simulation; soil compaction; soil erosion; stakeholder engagement; water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043319480

Temporal land cover maps increase the efficiency of land monitoring process by providing a set of observations so that any changes in the landscape can be tracked. So far, many land change monitoring efforts have been limited to small regions and analysing local processes, because there has been a lack of fine resolution global land cover maps for regional and global studies. Recently, the availability of bi-temporal GlobeLand30 product for years 2000 and 2010 has strengthened our land monitoring observations through a 10-year window at 30-meter resolution. The main objective of this study is to explore the land cover changes within 2000–2010 in one of the most dynamic regions in the Middle East. To do so, GlobeLand30 datasets were used for characterizing the regional landscapes and the distribution of the existing land cover types. Moreover, the study aims at predicting the future land cover patterns by 2030 based on the historical changes. The quantitative analysis reveals a high degree of changes from the majority of land types to barelands with the highest contribution from grasslands and shrublands. The vibrant spots of change are located on central Iran towards its eastern border while the persistent spots are located on its north and northwestern parts. The predictive measures using Markov chain analysis message forthcoming changes in favor of increasing barelands being taken from grasslands, cultivated lands, and shrublands. The findings are beneficial to a wide range of end users including academics, land managers, and environmentalists on a) which resources were available in the first decade of 21st century, and b) how they were treated within a decade, and c) how the resources will evolve within the following two decades.

In this context, the viticultural sector is one of those most challenged by CC due to the need to combine grape quality, grapevine cultivar adaptation and therefore farmers' future incomes. Thus, understanding how suitability for viticulture is changing under CC is of primary interest in the development of adaptation strategies in traditional wine-growing regions. Considering that climate is an essential part of the terroir system, the expected variability in climate change could have a marked influence on terroir resilience with important effects on local farming communities in viticultural regions. From this perspective, the aim of this paper is to define a new dynamic viticultural zoning procedure that is able to integrate the effects of CC on grape quality responses and evaluate terroir resilience, providing a support tool for stakeholders involved in viticultural planning (winegrowers, winegrower consortiums, policy makers etc.). To achieve these aims, a Hybrid Land Evaluation System, combining qualitative (standard Land Evaluation) and quantitative (simulation model) approaches, was applied within a traditional region devoted to high quality wine production in Southern Italy (Valle Telesina, BN), for a specific grapevine cultivar (Aglianico). The work employed high resolution climate projections that were derived under two different IPCC scenarios, namely RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. The results obtained indicate that: (i) only 2% of the suitable area of Valle Telesina expresses the concept of terroir resilience orientated towards Aglianico ultra quality grape production; (ii) within 2010–2040, it is expected that 41% of the area suitable for Aglianico cultivation will need irrigation to achieve quality grape production; (iii) by 2100, climate change benefits for the cultivation of Aglianico will decrease, as well as the suitable areas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Dynamic Viticultural zoning; Grapes quality; SWAP","Breweries; Cultivation; Quality control; Wine; Zoning; Adaptation strategies; Agricultural sector; Climate projection; Farming communities; Grapevine cultivars; High resolution; Simulation model; SWAP; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; crop production; cultivar; fruit; stakeholder; viticulture; agricultural worker; Article; climate change; crop production; dynamic viticultural zoning; grape; irrigation (agriculture); land use; nonhuman; priority journal; quality control; simulation; soil analysis; strategic planning; terroir resilience; wine; Italy; Vitaceae; Vitis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038029421

Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) is an industrial process that converts coal into product gas. UCG is a promising technology with a lot of health, safety and environmental advantages over conventional mining techniques. UCG carries risks to human health, agriculture and the environment. This article briefly analyzes the advantages and negative environmental impacts of UCG. It describes experimental objects, mathematical models as tools for simulation cases and it used coal from UCG experiments in Cigel, Barbara and Wieczorek mines to analyze the environmental impacts of UCG. The gasification converts the carbon in the coal to syngas and heat. We carried out a numerical simulation of the two-dimensional unstable heat conduction in the coal and overburden, with the aim of judging the influence of this heat source on the surroundings, including the surface. The results show that the temperature in the surrounding rock first increases and then decreases with time, the peak of the temperature curve decreases gradually, and its position moves inside the surrounding rock from the ignition point. A small amount of potentially dangerous syngas leaks from the UCG cavity and channels into vulnerable areas depending on working pressures. The danger of explosion and poisoning in vulnerable zones was evaluated by the simulation model. The results show that the danger is real but by monitoring and controlling the air in the vulnerable area it is possible to reduce this risk. © 2018 by the authors.","Mathematical models; Simulations; Surface temperature; Syngas explosion; Syngas-CO poisoning; Temperature distribution; Underground coal gasification (UCG)","carbon monoxide; coal; cost analysis; demand analysis; environmental impact; exploitation; health risk; heat source; numerical model; occupational exposure; poisoning; surface temperature; thermal conductivity; two-dimensional modeling; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046996373

China is a significant agricultural country of the world; however, the agricultural machinery emissions research is at an early stage, and an emission inventory with a high temporal-spatial resolution is still needed. In this study, a comprehensive emission inventory with a high temporal-spatial resolution for agricultural machinery in China was first developed. The results showed that the total emissions in 2014 were 262.69 Gg, 249.25 Gg, 1211.39 Gg, 2192.05 Gg, 1448.16 Gg and 25.14 Gg for PM10, PM2.5, THC, NOx, CO and SO2, respectively. Tractors and farm transport vehicles were the top two greatest contributors, accounting for approximately 39.9%-53.6% and 17.4%-24.6%, respectively, of the total emissions of the five pollutants (except THC). The farm transport vehicles contributed the most (81.8%) to the THC emissions. The county-level emissions were further allocated into 1 km × 1 km grids according to source-specific allocation surrogates. The spatial characteristic analysis indicated that high emissions were distributed in northeast, north and central-south China. To obtain a high temporal resolution emission inventory, a comprehensive investigation on the agricultural practice timing in different provinces was conducted. Then, the annual emissions in the different provinces were distributed to a spatial resolution of ten-day periods (i.e. the early, mid- and late ten-day periods in each month). It was found that higher emissions in China occurred in late April, mid-June and early October. In addition, the emission uncertainty was also analyzed based on the Monte Carlo simulation. The estimated high temporal-spatial resolution emission inventory could provide important basic information for environmental/climate implications research, emission control policy making, and air quality modeling. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural machinery emissions; China; County-level; Spatial distribution; Temporal distribution","Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Air pollution; Air quality; Emission control; Image resolution; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Quality control; Uncertainty analysis; Agricultural practices; Air pollutant emission; China; County level; Emission uncertainties; High temporal resolution; Spatial characteristics; Temporal distribution; Spatial distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043593671

Innovative technologies are needed to design strategies that will achieve higher crop yields on less land and with fewer resources. Computational modeling coupled with advanced scientific visualization enables researchers to explore and interact with complex agriculture, nutrition, and climate data to predict how crops will respond to untested environments. These virtual observations and predictions can direct the development of crop ideotypes designed to meet future yield and nutritional demands. This review surveys modeling strategies for the development of crop ideotypes and scientific visualization technologies that have led to discoveries in ""big data"" analysis. Combined modeling and visualization approaches have been used to realistically simulate crops and to guide selection that immediately enhances crop quantity and quality under challenging environmental conditions.

Field based assessment of technologies needs to move beyond production and economic performance to include environment, social and human condition. In this study we systematically consider all five domains of SI based on participatory action research (PAR) initiated in 2012 at three Central Malawi sites that varied in agroecology from low to high potential. Fifteen SI indicators were assessed for four technologies: sole maize (Zea mays L.) with 0 and recommended fertilization (69 kg N ha− 1 and 9 kg P ha− 1), pigeonpea (Cajanus Cajun (L.) Millsp.)-maize intercrop (half rate fertilizer), and doubled up legume rotation (DLR, a pigeonpea-groundnut intercrop) sequenced with maize at half rate fertilizer in that phase. Through radar charts SI performance and tradeoffs were visualized, and causal loop analysis allowed identification of research gaps. SI indicator assessments included crop performance from on-farm trials, profitability, modeled probability of food sufficiency, risk of crop failure and ratings of technologies by women farmers who were engaged in evaluation of technologies through participatory research. The PAR included six mother trials, 236 baby trial farmers and a survey that was carried out with 324 farmers (baby trial farmers plus control farmers) to document socio-economic factors and management practices on focal fields. Replicated mother trials further provided the basis for simulation modeling (APSIM) of weather-associated crop failure risk and slow processes such as soil carbon (C) accrual. Radar charts were used to visualize SI performance of the technologies. Environmental performance of the two pigeonpea-diversified technologies was variable, but generally high compared with sole maize systems, due to gains in vegetative biomass, duration of cover and biological nitrogen (N) fixation. Maize production and economic assessment varied by site, and with steeper tradeoffs for legume diversification in the mesic site, less so in the marginal site. The domains of social and human capacity building were superior for legume integration, notably in terms of diverse diet, food security and farmer preferences (notably, female farmers generally favored legume crops). Performance varied by site with legume systems most beneficial at the most marginal site, including less risk of crop failure than unfertilized maize. Causal loop analyses identified regulators of SI that require further attention, notably: crop-livestock conflicts and opportunities, male-female control of legume crop production, and residue management. Overall, the SI indicators framework provided a systematic means to consider tradeoffs and opportunities associated with novel crop combinations and management practices. © 2018 The Authors","Causal loop; Indicators; Legume; Sustainable intensification; Tradeoffs","action research; agroecology; alternative agriculture; bioindicator; capacity building; crop performance; crop rotation; crop yield; fertilizer application; food security; legume; maize; management practice; participatory approach; profitability; socioeconomic conditions; trade-off; Malawi; Cajanus; Cajanus cajan; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043259867

The role of regional and local-level actors is critical in developing effective policy responses that accommodate such uncertainty in a flexible and informed way across governance levels. This study identified potential regional challenges in arable land use systems, which may arise from climate and socio-economic change for two counties in western Hungary: Veszprém and Tolna. An empirically-grounded, agent-based model was developed from an extensive farmer household survey about local land use practices. The model was used to project future patterns of arable land use under four localised, stakeholder-driven scenarios of plausible future socio-economic and climate change. The results show strong differences in farmers' behaviour and current agricultural land use patterns between the two regions, highlighting the need to implement focused policy at the regional level. For instance, policy that encourages local food security may need to support improvements in the capacity of farmers to adapt to physical constraints in Veszprém and farmer access to social capital and environmental awareness in Tolna. It is further suggested that the two regions will experience different challenges to adaptation under possible future conditions (up to 2100). For example, Veszprém was projected to have increased fallow land under a scenario with high inequality, ineffective institutions and higher-end climate change, implying risks of land abandonment. By contrast, Tolna was projected to have a considerable decline in major cereals under a scenario assuming a de-globalising future with moderate climate change, inferring challenges to local food self-sufficiency. The study provides insight into how socio-economic and physical factors influence the selection of crop rotation plans by farmers in western Hungary and how farmer behaviour may affect future risks to agricultural land systems under environmental change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural land use; Crop rotation; Empirically-grounded agent-based model; Environmental change impact assessment; Farmer household survey; Stakeholder-driven scenarios","Agricultural robots; Autonomous agents; Climate models; Computational methods; Crops; Economic analysis; Food supply; Land use; Risk perception; Simulation platform; Surveys; Agent-based model; Agricultural land use; Crop rotation; Environmental change; Household surveys; Stakeholder-driven scenarios; Climate change; agricultural land; climate change; climate effect; crop rotation; empirical analysis; environmental change; environmental impact assessment; household survey; land use; numerical model; socioeconomic conditions; stakeholder; agricultural land; agricultural worker; Article; cereal; climate change; crop improvement; cropping system; environmental change; environmental policy; environmental protection; food security; global change; household; Hungary; land use; politics; priority journal; social capital; socioeconomics; agriculture; catering service; crop; growth, development and aging; human; Hungary; procedures; Hungary; Agriculture; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Farmers; Food Supply; Humans; Hungary; Socioeconomic Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031506367

A critical aspect in the design of on-farm intervention programmes concerns the potential technical cost-effectiveness of packages of control measures. The European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive (WFD) calls for Programmes of Measures (PoMs) to protect freshwater environments and these comprise ‘basic’ (mandatory) and ‘supplementary’ (incentivised) options. Recent work has used measure review, elicitation of stakeholder attitudes and a process-based modelling framework to identify a new alternative set of ‘basic’ agricultural sector control measures for nutrient and sediment abatement across England. Following an initial scientific review of 708 measures, 90 were identified for further consideration at an industry workshop and 63 had industry support. Optimisation modelling was undertaken to identify a shortlist of measures using the Demonstration Test Catchments as sentinel agricultural landscapes. Optimisation selected 12 measures relevant to livestock or arable systems. Model simulations of 95% implementation of these 12 candidate ‘basic’ measures, in addition to business-as-usual, suggested reductions in the national agricultural nitrate load of 2.5%, whilst corresponding reductions in phosphorus and sediment were 11.9% and 5.6%, respectively. The total cost of applying the candidate ‘basic’ measures across the whole of England was estimated to be £450 million per annum, which is equivalent to £52 per hectare of agricultural land.

Land use planning is a beforehand task that needs to estimate the possible eco-hydrological consequences of land use changes at the watershed scale. The method based on combination of land use scenarios and hydrological model simulations usually provides guidance suggestions for land use planning and land management. However, the setting of land use scenarios often ignores the objective natural conditions in local region. In this paper, a suitability evaluation method was developed, which synthetically considered the topographic, soil, meteorological and water supply conditions on the agriculture land, to obtain land use planning scenarios in the upstream of the Huaihe River basin. Subsequently, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was employed to evaluate the influences of land use scenarios on eco-hydrological responses. Model calibration and validation were performed based on the land use status in 2000, after which the validated simulations were conducted based on the planning scenarios. Suitability evaluation results demonstrated that 40.83% of the existing agriculture land in 2000 was considered to be unsuitable, especially in the northern part of the studied area, where plantations of grass and forest were implemented to derive the short-term and long-term land planning scenarios, respectively. The SWAT model with daily time step was set up for the studied area. It simulated reasonably the relationship between rainfall and runoff with the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of 0.72 and 0.66 for the calibration and the validation periods. Relative changes of eco-hydrological components simulated by the validated SWAT model were analyzed both temporally and spatially. The simulation results counted at multiple temporal scales showed that both short-term and long-term land use planning operations reduced the maximum runoff and total water yield as well as the total sediment loads, meanwhile, increased the evapotranspiration. For runoff components, the decreasing surface runoff and the increasing groundwater were much more significant than the increasing lateral flow. Sub-basin analyses revealed that the simulated changes in eco-hydrological responses varied spatially, whereas the decreases in total water yield and the surface runoff and the increase in evapotranspiration were closely related to the percentages of de-farming in sub-basins. Overall the eco-hydrological responses to long-term land use planning were more profound than that to short-term land use planning. This study provides a synthetic suitability evaluation method for creating land use planning scenario, which overcomes the shortcoming of traditional way of assigning land use scenario that being lack of objectivity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Eco-hydrological responses; Land suitability evaluation; Land use planning; SWAT model","Agriculture; Deforestation; Evapotranspiration; Groundwater; Rain; Runoff; Water supply; Watersheds; Agricultural activities; Hydrological response; Land suitability; Land Use Planning; Model calibration and validation; Soil and water assessment tool; Suitability evaluation; SWAT model; Land use; agricultural land; calibration; ecohydrology; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; hydrological response; land management; land use; land use planning; model validation; rainfall; runoff; scenario analysis; simulation; soil and water assessment tool; watershed; China; Huai Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042563732

Here, we examine the relative merits of afforestation, reforestation, management changes, and harvest residue bioenergy use in the Pacific Northwest. This region represents some of the highest carbon density forests in the world, which can store carbon in trees for 800 y or more. Oregon’s net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) was equivalent to 72% of total emissions in 2011–2015. By 2100, simulations show increased net carbon uptake with little change in wildfires. Reforestation, afforestation, lengthened harvest cycles on private lands, and restricting harvest on public lands increase NECB 56% by 2100, with the latter two actions contributing the most. Resultant cobenefits included water availability and biodiversity, primarily from increased forest area, age, and species diversity. Converting 127,000 ha of irrigated grass crops to native forests could decrease irrigation demand by 233 billion m3·y−1. Utilizing harvest residues for bioenergy production instead of leaving them in forests to decompose increased emissions in the short-term (50 y), reducing mitigation effectiveness. Increasing forest carbon on public lands reduced emissions compared with storage in wood products because the residence time is more than twice that of wood products. Hence, temperate forests with high carbon densities and lower vulnerability to mortality have substantial potential for reducing forest sector emissions. Our analysis framework provides a template for assessments in other temperate regions. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

Proper crop selection for a given region can lessen the need for irrigation and timing of N fertilizer application with crop N demand can potentially reduce N2O emissions and increase N use efficiency while reducing residual soil N and N leaching. However, increased variability in precipitation is an expectation of climate change and makes predicting biomass and gas flux responses to management more challenging. We used the DayCent model to test hypotheses about input intensity controls on sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) productivity and greenhouse gas emissions in the southwestern United States under future climate. Sorghum had been previously parameterized for DayCent, but an inverse-modeling via parameter estimation method significantly improved model validation to field data. Aboveground production and N2O flux were more responsive to N additions than irrigation, but simulations with future climate produced lower values for sorghum than current climate. We found positive interactions between irrigation at increased N application for N2O and CO2 fluxes. Extremes in sorghum production under future climate were a function of biomass accumulation trajectories related to daily soil water and mineral N. Root C inputs correlated with soil organic C pools, but overall soil C declined at the decadal scale under current weather while modest gains were simulated under future weather. Scaling biomass and N2O fluxes by unit N and water input revealed that sorghum can be productive without irrigation, and the effect of irrigating crops is difficult to forecast when precipitation is variable within the growing season. These simulation results demonstrate the importance of understanding sorghum production and greenhouse gas emissions at daily scales when assessing annual and decadal-scale management decisions’ effects on aspects of arid and semiarid agroecosystem biogeochemistry. © 2018 Duval et al.

Metrics linking diet quality and sustainability have typically focused on a limited suite of indicators, and have not included food waste. To address this important research gap, we examine the relationship between food waste, diet quality, nutrient waste, and multiple measures of sustainability: use of cropland, irrigation water, pesticides, and fertilizers. Data on food intake, food waste, and application rates of agricultural amendments were collected from diverse US government sources. Diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index-2015. A biophysical simulation model was used to estimate the amount of cropland associated with wasted food. This analysis finds that US consumers wasted 422g of food per person daily, with 30 million acres of cropland used to produce this food every year. This accounts for 30% of daily calories available for consumption, one-quarter of daily food (by weight) available for consumption, and 7% of annual cropland acreage. Higher quality diets were associated with greater amounts of food waste and greater amounts of wasted irrigation water and pesticides, but less cropland waste. This is largely due to fruits and vegetables, which are health-promoting and require small amounts of cropland, but require substantial amounts of agricultural inputs. These results suggest that simultaneous efforts to improve diet quality and reduce food waste are necessary. Increasing consumers’ knowledge about how to prepare and store fruits and vegetables will be one of the practical solutions to reducing food waste. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Taking Guanlin Town, Yixing City, Jiangsu Province as a case, and using remote sensing images, questionnaire survey and socioeconomic data, this study built a model based on multi-agent system and cellular automata to quantitatively analyze the influence of the natural and locational factors and agents' decision-making behaviors on area and space change of rural land and their driving mechanism. The results showed that: 1) Rural land use change was influenced by natural environment factors, social environment factors and distance variables. The concrete factors had varied influences on different types of rural land use changes. Arable land change was mainly influenced by soil pH value, per capita annual net income of farmers and distance to waters. The change probabilities would increase by 1.161 and 1.313 times respectively with soil pH value and per capita annual net income of farmers increasing by one unit, while the change probabilities would decrease by 0.780 time with one unit increasing in distance to waters. Aquiculture water surface change was mainly influenced by slope, per capita annual net income of farmers and distance to waters. The change probabilities would increase by 1.065 and 1.067 times respectively with one unit increasing in slope and distance to waters, while the change probabilities would decrease by 0.761 time with per capita annual net income of farmers increasing by one unit. Rural residential land change was mainly influenced by surface soil texture, counterpart funds of public welfare and distance to roads. The change probabilities would increase by 1.995, 1.380 and 1.179 times respectively with one unit increasing in surface soil texture, counterpart funds of public welfare and distance to roads. Enterprise land change was mainly influenced by slope, gross industrial output value and distance to roads. The change probabilities would increase by 1.064 and 1.130 times respectively with one unit increasing in slope and distance to roads, while the change probabilities would decrease by 0.300 time with one unit increasing in gross industrial output value. Ecological land change was mainly influenced by output value of agriculture, fishery and industry. The change probabilities would increase by 1.093, 1.017 and 1.371 times respectively with one unit increasing in output value of agriculture, fishery and industry. 2) The rural land use agents consisted of government, enterprises and farmers. Different types of rural land use changes were influenced by different agents' decision-making behaviors. Agents' decision-making behaviors of land use expansion were affected by their individual characteristics, economic characteristics and family characteristics, which could lead to area change of rural land. Relocation decision-making behaviors were affected by regional traffic factors such as distance to waters, roads, and markets, which resulted in spatial change of rural land. As for the planner and decision maker of rural land use, decision-making behaviors of government had substantial influence on change of each land use type. Area and space distribution changes of enterprise land were mainly influenced by decision-making behaviors of enterprises, with a weight of 0.41. Enterprise agents' decision-making behaviors of land use expansion were influenced by their individual characteristics and economic conditions such as total assets, age and academic composition of employees, idle land area. Relocation decision-making behaviors were influenced by zonal and traffic factors such as distance to markets and distance to roads. Area and space distribution changes of arable land, aquiculture water surface and rural residential land were mainly influenced by decision-making behaviors of farmers, with the weights of up to 0.30. Farmers' decision-making behaviors of land use expansion were influenced by their individual characteristics such as age and academic qualification, and domestic characteristics such as population and income. Relocation decision-making behaviors were influenced by arable land quality, water quality and distance to roads. Rural land use change was driven by the comprehensive effect of natural and locational factors and agents' decision-making behaviors. It is feasible to simulate rural land use change with the model combining cellular automata and multi-agent system. The Kappa coefficient of the model was 0.8087, which indicated that simulation results had high reliability. The research can provide scientific basis for the systematic study of rural land use change, and for the more accurate analysis of its driving mechanism. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Farmers may therefore perceive transition to SCP as very complex. The Dual Indicator Set for Crop Protection Sustainability (DISCUSS) can handle this complexity. To provide targeted support throughout the transition to SCP, complexity capture must be synchronised with the time course of on-farm decision-making. Tool use must be tuned to farmer awareness and appropriate level of data in consecutive stages. This paper thus explores the potential functionalities of DISCUSS in relation to both complexity and time. Results from apple and potato crop protection show three potential functions: DISCUSS can be used as (1) a simulation tool for communication and decision support, (2) an assessment and monitoring tool, and (3) a discussion support tool for farmer groups. Analysis of these functionalities using a framework for guiding on-farm sustainability assessment and strategic decision-making shows how each functionality can support the consecutive steps of transition to SCP, i.e. using the right tool functionality at the right time. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Decision support; Discussion support; Indicators; Monitoring; Simulation; Stepwise implementation; Sustainable crop protection","Agriculture; Decision making; Decision support systems; Indicators (instruments); Monitoring; Sustainable development; Crop protection; Decision supports; Discussion support; Simulation; Stepwise implementation; Crops; alternative agriculture; communication; complexity; crop plant; crop production; decision support system; farmers attitude; farmers knowledge; planning method; potato; sustainability; agricultural land; agricultural worker; apple; Article; conceptual framework; crop protection; decision making; Dual Indicator Set for Crop Protection Sustainability; environmental parameters; environmental sustainability; female; human; integrated pest management; interpersonal communication; knowledge base; male; pollution control; potato; priority journal; questionnaire; safety; skill; sustainable crop protection; time; article; awareness; decision support system; nonhuman; simulation; tool use; Malus x domestica; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032291234

The windblown dust emission algorithm was the Air Force Weather Agency model. In comparison with ground-based PM10observations, the model unevenly reproduces the dust-storm events. The model adequately estimates the location and timing of the events, but it is unable to precisely replicate the magnitude and timing of the elevated hourly concentrations of particles 10 µm and smaller ([PM10]).Furthermore, the model underestimated [PM10] in highly agricultural Pinal County because it underestimated surface wind speeds and because the model’s erodible fractions of the land surface data were too coarse to effectively resolve the active and abandoned agricultural lands. In contrast, the model overestimated [PM10] in western Arizona along the Colorado River because it generated daytime sea breezes (from the nearby Gulf of California) for which the surface-layer speeds were too strong. In Phoenix, AZ, the model’s performance depended on the event, with both under- and overestimations partly due to incorrect representation of urban features. Sensitivity tests indicate that [PM10] highly relies on meteorological forcing. Increasing the fraction of erodible surfaces in the Pinal County agricultural areas improved the simulation of [PM10] in that region. Both 24-hr and 1-hr measured [PM10] were, for the most part, and especially in Pinal County, extremely elevated, with the former exceeding the health standard by as much as 10-fold and the latter exceeding health-based guidelines by as much as 70-fold. Monsoonal thunderstorms not only produce elevated [PM10], but also cause urban flash floods and disrupt water resource deliveries. Given the severity and frequency of these dust storms, and conceding that the modeling system applied in this work did not produce the desired agreement between simulations and observations, additional research in both the windblown dust emissions model and the weather research/physicochemical model is called for. Implications: While many dust storms can be considered to be natural, in semi-arid climates such storms often have an anthropogenic component in their sources of dust. Applying the natural, exceptional events policy to these storms with strong signatures of anthropogenic sources would appear not only to be misguided but also to stifle genuine regulatory efforts at remediation. Those dust storms that have resulted, in part, from passage over abandoned farm land should no longer be considered “natural”; policymakers and lawmakers need to compel the owners of such land to reduce its potential for windblown dust. © 2018 A&WMA.",,"Agriculture; Dust; Storms; Water resources; Anthropogenic components; Anthropogenic sources; Chemistry modeling; Exceptional events; Gulf of California; Meteorological forcing; Weather research and forecasting; Weather research and forecasting models; Weather forecasting; agricultural land; air force; Arizona; Article; chemistry; clinical effectiveness; comparative study; concentration process; controlled study; dust; flooding; forecasting; human; hurricane; meteorology; particulate matter; priority journal; rural area; sea; semiarid climate; sensitivity analysis; surface area; velocity; water supply; weather; wind; algorithm; analysis; computer simulation; dust; environmental monitoring; forecasting; meteorology; particulate matter; procedures; season; theoretical model; weather; wind; Algorithms; Arizona; Computer Simulation; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Forecasting; Meteorology; Models, Theoretical; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Weather; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045630226

However, antimicrobial use (AMU) inevitably leads to the selection of resistant bacteria, potentially infecting humans. As a global public threat, antimicrobial resistance has led policy makers to implement regulations supervising AMU. The objective of our research was to investigate the farm impact of several potential policies aimed at decreasing AMU. We modeled a dairy herd of 1000 cows with an average level of disease prevalence for the nine most frequent bacterial dairy diseases found in western countries. We calculated the farm net costs of AMU prohibition, as well as cost increases in antimicrobial treatments prices, and an increase in the milk withdrawal period after AMU. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of output and input prices, and disease prevalence. At a mean disease prevalence, the average net costs of not using antimicrobials were $61 per cow per year greater compared to a scenario modeling current farm AMU. The model predicted that the minimum and maximum increased costs associated with AMU prohibition were $46 and $73 per cow per year compared to current AMU. In each scenario, the cost difference increased with disease prevalence. Sensitivity analysis showed that the three stochastic variables which most significantly influenced the cost difference were respectively, cow replacement prices, cow slaughter price, and the milk price. Antimicrobial price increases of a factor of five, or extending the milk withdrawal period by 15 days, resulted in increasing the costs of diseases to a level where the farmer was better off not using antimicrobials. Our results suggest that the farm level costs of AMU prohibition in many cases might be minor, although the consequences of any policy instrument should be carefully evaluated to reach the ultimate goal of decreasing AMU without threatening the sustainability of milk production. © 2018 Lhermie et al.

Agricultural expansion and intensification contributes to global environmental change and risks the long-term sustainability of the planet. It has been proposed that no more than 15% of the global ice-free land surface should be converted to cropland. Bioenergy production for land-based climate mitigation places additional pressure on limited land resources. Here we test normative targets of food supply and bioenergy production within the cropland planetary boundary using a global land-use model. The results suggest supplying the global population with adequate food is possible without cropland expansion exceeding the planetary boundary. Yet this requires an increase in food production, especially in developing countries, as well as a decrease in global crop yield gaps. However, under current assumptions of future food requirements, it was not possible to also produce significant amounts of first generation bioenergy without cropland expansion. These results suggest that meeting food and bioenergy demands within the planetary boundaries would need a shift away from current trends, for example, requiring major change in the demand-side of the food system or advancing biotechnologies. © 2018 Henry et al.

For this purpose, the Guadalquivir River Basin, located in southern Spain, is used as a case study. Fifteen representative farm types were considered to simulate water trading through public tender for purchasing and selling temporary water rights. The model is built at the basin level to estimate the aggregate demand and supply curves to establish expected exchange prices, volumes of water traded, enhancement in economic efficiency and improvement in rural development as measured by employment generation. The simulation results show that the proposed water bank encourages water transfers from 19% of the total water used in the case of a moderate drought to almost 40% in the case of an extreme drought, significantly reducing the economic and labor demand losses due to water shortages. The public water agency can recover all of the incurred water bank operation costs by implementing a €0.01/m3 price differential between purchase and sale prices without meaningfully affecting the performance of the water bank. Thus, we conclude that the implementation of this kind of water bank during droughts would be useful in mitigating negative effects of droughts. Thus, policymakers are encouraged to create water banks as an effective instrument to cope with droughts. © 2017 The Author(s)","Guadalquivir river basin; Irrigated agriculture; Modeling; Spain; Water banks","Agriculture; Banks (bodies of water); Commerce; Costs; Drought; Irrigation; Models; Regional planning; Rivers; Sales; Water supply; Watersheds; Aggregate demands; Economic efficiency; Irrigated agriculture; Irrigation waters; River basins; Spain; Water availability; Water banks; Water resources; demand analysis; drought; employment; hydrological modeling; irrigation system; policy analysis; policy implementation; resource allocation; river bank; river basin; river water; rural development; water availability; water resource; water supply; Andalucia; Guadalquivir River; Spain; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041443816

Due to the spatio-temporal variability of PPP applications and of the processes regulating their transport to surface waters, aquatic organisms are typically exposed to pulses of contaminants. In small mountain watersheds, where runoff fluxes are more rapid due to the steep slopes, such exposure peaks are particularly likely to occur. In this work, a spatially explicit, dynamic model for predicting pesticide exposure in surface waters of cultivated mountain basins (DynAPlus) has been developed. The model has been applied to a small mountain watershed (133 km2) located in the Italian Eastern Alps and characterized by intensive agriculture (apple orchards) around the main river and its tributaries. DynAPlus performance was evaluated for chlorpyrifos through experimental monitoring, using samples collected during the 2011 and 2012 productive seasons. The comparison between predictions and measurements resulted in a good agreement (R2 = 0.49, efficiency factor 0.60), although a more accurate spatial information in the input scenario (e.g., field-specific applications, rainfall amount, soil properties) would dramatically improve model performance. A set of illustrative simulations performed for three PPPs highlighted the potential role of DynAPlus in improving exposure predictions for ecological risk assessment and pesticide management practices (e.g., for active ingredient and application rate selection), as well as for planning efficient monitoring campaigns and/or interpreting monitoring data. However, some model improvements (e.g., solid erosion and transport) and a more thorough model validation are desirable to enlarge the applicability domain. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Curve number; DOC; Dynamic scenario; Orchard; Runoff; Slope","Agriculture; Aquatic ecosystems; Aquatic organisms; Ecology; Farms; Forecasting; Health risks; Landforms; Orchards; Pesticides; Risk assessment; Runoff; Watersheds; Curve numbers; Dynamic scenarios; Ecological risk assessment; Efficient monitoring; Plant protection products; Slope; Spatial informations; Spatiotemporal variability; Surface waters; agricultural chemical; chlorpyrifos; etofenprox; pesticide; pirimicarb; rain; surface water; unclassified drug; basin; chlorpyrifos; mountain region; orchard; pesticide residue; prediction; runoff; slope; watershed; Article; catchment; comparative study; computer prediction; concentration (parameters); cultivated land; dynamics; ecotoxicity; environmental exposure; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental monitoring; Italy; land use; orchard; priority journal; quality control; risk assessment; runoff; seasonal variation; simulation; soil erosion; soil property; terrestrial surface waters; water sampling; watershed; Alps; Eastern Alps; Italy; Malus x domestica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030258286

Current research predominantly provides useful insights into technological or techno-economic aspects of agricultural residue harvesting and processing, but, for investors in bio-refineries, one of the main challenges remains ensuring a continuous feedstock supply to the plant. In this article, we present the results of a mixed-method approach, combining insights from semi-structured interviews with simulation results of an agent-based model. This model simulates the decisions of individual economic actors in the value chain – including farmers, custom harvesters and one processor – under four coordination scenarios (direct sale, a custom harvester, mediated contract and two cooperative structures). Our results provide useful insights in the way different factors influence the ability to ensure a continuous feedstock supply. We find that besides actors’ willingness, actors’ coordination and supply reliability, also actors’ actual participation and economic context play a crucial role. Furthermore, we are able to demonstrate the complex interplay between these factors.

The present study seeks to compare the time course of Alfa grass biomass and the livestock raised on these distinctive rangelands under two different land-use strategies. The traditional one has nomads as the main inhabitants of these lands. For centuries, their strategy for alleviating pressure on resources was to move from one area to other. The more recent sedentary land-use leads to overgrazing supported by the massive use of cheap supplemental feed. Additionally, the model was used as a platform to launch scenarios for sustainable land-use management under a competitive market-economy. A key finding for preserving grazing resources was the increment of supplemental feed prices, which is compatible with stocking rates higher than the historical ones. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Desertification; Food security; Land-use changes; Overgrazing; Rangelands; SD modelling","Agriculture; Climatology; Economics; Food supply; Desertification; Food security; Land-use change; Overgrazing; Rangelands; Land use; desertification; food security; land management; land use change; modeling; overgrazing; rangeland; resource management; steppe; sustainable development; Algeria; animal food; Article; biomass; breeding; climate; desertification; economic aspect; environmental impact; environmental sustainability; farming system; grazing; grazing management; landscape ecology; livestock; priority journal; rangeland; ruminant; simulation; steppe; Stipa tenacissima; vegetation; Algeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028295240

WII is an innovative risk management instrument that causes low administration and regulation costs. Moreover, index insurance is plagued neither by moral hazard nor by adverse selection. Nonetheless, WII has been little used to date in agriculture. Design/methodology/approach: An extra-laboratory experiment in the form of a multi-period, single-person business simulation game is conducted with farmers as experimental subjects to investigate the reasons for the low willingness to adopt WII. Findings: First, the demand for WII decreases as the premium loading increases. Second, a transparent communication of the loading reduces demand, indicating that farmers refrain from transactions if they feel that the other party earns (too) much money. Third, communicating to farmers that the index insurance has been subsidized raises demand even though insurance costs in terms of loading are kept constant. This can be taken as an indication that farmers interpret subsidies as a signal for profitable action. Originality/value: Using an experimental approach and going beyond observational research, this study investigates the prominent question of farmers’ risk management and innovation adoption behavior, and, in particular, the behavioral effect of subsidies. Using a randomized controlled trial, the real behavior of real subjects with real incentives is studied under controlled experimental conditions. Compared to prior studies, the external validity of the experiment is improved by recruiting farmers instead of a convenience group of students. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bounded rationality; Business simulation games; Extra-laboratory experiment; Subsidization; Weather index insurance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035150210

Two key areas have been identified in this research, they are considered to have the potential to simultaneously help to mitigate the problems mentioned above: 1) Improved design of buildings and cities to encourage urban biodiversity, i.e. better urban design and architectural practices. 2) Enhanced methods to produce, store and distribute food, i.e. improved rural and urban agriculture: produce, storage and distribution. Scrutiny into these topics lead this investigation into vertical farming and the exploration on how it can be improved. A simulation methodology is under development, aiming to reproduce the potential capabilities of vertical farms, exploring their wider viability and their integration into existing and new buildings. This paper follows the development of this methodology, its current capabilities and the future directions of this ongoing investigation. © 2019 WIT Press","Computer simulation; Plants and architecture; Sustainable urban agriculture; Vertical farming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062892724

The main attractiveness of Zigbee wireless module is in its potential to set up self-organizing network that requires no network backbone and extremely low cost with low-power wireless networking. Many simulations have been performed for testing the capabilities of wireless communication device and the battery lifetime. However, the results from the simulation do not capture the actual environment effects and the simulators allow users to isolate certain factors by tuning to different parameters. This paper provides experimental results on actual voltage drop using Zigbee protocol devices when communicating temperature, humidity and soil moisture data using a 900mAh battery both in indoor and outdoor environments. It is observed that the wireless nodes are capable of relaying data up to 143 meters on unobstructed line of sights in an outdoor environment with some observation of packet drop. The results differ from previous researches that perform the experiments on shorter range which only covers 50 cm distance between transmitter node and receiver node for 2 bytes of data transfer. The paper proposes a new method for battery lifetime estimation which is derived from number of times data packet can be transmitted. This study also suggests to conduct experiment by including the environmental factors to capture the actual performance of wireless device and the impact to packet drop. The experiment concludes the suitability of Zigbee wireless communication for short-range applications of up to 143 meters which is significantly farther than other reported experiments. © 2018 Insight Society.","Arduino; Lifetime; Xbee; Zigbee wireless technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059522459

The study employed a computable general equilibrium model given its appropriateness in handling economy-wide and the welfare effect of specific policies. Simulations results reveal that the welfare of both rich and poor households improves with an increase in agriculture expenditure share. The improvement for both households as well as overall economic welfare was found to be highest under simulation one (25 per cent increase in agriculture expenditure share), followed by simulation two (10 per cent increase in agriculture expenditure share) and then simulation three (5 per cent increase in agriculture expenditure share).

Employing a state-of-the-art biobased variant of a computable general equilibrium model, this study assesses the perceived medium-term benefits, risks and trade-offs which arise from an advanced biofuels plan, two exploratory scenarios of a more 'sustainable' conventional biofuels plan and a 'no-mandate' scenario. Consistent with more recent studies, none of the scenarios considered present significant challenges to EU food-security or agricultural land usage. An illustrative advanced biofuels plan simulation requires non-trivial public support to implement whilst a degree of competition for biomass with (high-value) advanced biomass material industries is observed. On the other hand, it significantly alleviates land use pressures, whilst lignocellulose biomass prices are not expected to increase to unsustainable levels. Clearly, these observations are subject to assumptions on technological change, sustainable biomass limits, expected trends in fossil fuel prices and EU access to third-country trade. With these same caveats in mind, the switch to increased bioethanol production does not result in significant market tensions in biomass markets. © 2018 by the authors.

The simulation was carried out through the CLUE-S model (the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small regional extent) using CORINE Land Cover (CLC) database and several biophysical and socio-economic explanatory variables associated with the current land use/cover pattern. Because of the political and socio-economic changes that took place after 1990 and their relevance for the resulted spatial transformations in land use/cover pattern, two scenarios based on the annual change rate of the 1990-2000 and 2000-2006 were used in order to explore potential future land use/cover changes. Thus, the predicted maps indicate significant changes in the agricultural land use pattern mainly in relation to the local-level conversion processes. Two change flows stand out, i.e. intensification and extensification of agriculture. The first flow is more likely to occur in the Banat and Crișana Plains and Hills, the Transylvanian Tableland and west of the Romanian Plain, while the second will mainly occur in the Moldavian Plateau, the Dobrogea Plateau, the central part of the Romanian Plain and the Subcarpathians. Furthermore, a significant increase in the agricultural lands related to forest losses and decrease related to forest gains are expected in the plain regions, Transylvanian Tableland, Getic Piedmont, Moldavian Plateau and Subcarpathians. The results of the current research provide important information on the future spatial distribution of the agricultural land use classes in order to improve the general understanding on the causes and consequences of change.

To achieve a balance between water use and the need for food self-sufficiency, new water efficient irrigation strategies need to be developed that balance water use with farmer net return. The Crop Environment Resource Synthesis Wheat (CERES-Wheat model) was calibrated and evaluated with two years of data which consisted of 3–4 irrigation treatments, and the model was used to investigate long-term winter wheat productivity and water use from irrigation management in the North China Plain. The calibrated model simulated accurately above-ground biomass, grain yield and evapotranspiration of winter wheat in response to irrigation management. The calibrated model was then run using weather data from 1994–2016 in order to evaluate different irrigation strategies. The simulated results using historical weather data showed that grain yield and water use was sensitive to different irrigation strategies including amounts and dates of irrigation applications. The model simulated the highest yield when irrigation was applied at jointing (T9) in normal and dry rainfall years, and gave the highest simulated yields for irrigation at double ridge (T8) in wet years. A single simulated irrigation at jointing (T9) produced yields that were 88% compared to using a double irrigation treatment at T1 and T9 in wet years, 86% of that in normal years, and 91% of that in dry years. A single irrigation at jointing or double ridge produced higher water use efficiency because it obtained higher evapotranspiration. The simulated farmer irrigation practices produced the highest yield and net income. When the cost of water was taken into account, limited irrigation was found to be more profitable based on assumptions about future water costs. In order to increase farmer income, a subsidy will likely be needed to compensate farmers for yield reductions due to water savings. These results showed that there is a cost to the farmer for water conservation, but limiting irrigation to a single irrigation at jointing would minimize impact on farmer net return in North China Plain. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

The NASA GISS ModelE2 and GEOS-Chem models were used to simulate the near-present chemistry of the atmosphere. A suite of simulations that varied by model, meteorology, horizontal resolution, emissions inventory, and emissions year were performed, enabling an analysis of metric sensitivities to various model components. All simulations utilized consistent anthropogenic global emissions inventories (ECLIPSE V5a or CEDS), and an evaluation of simulated results were carried out for 2004–2006 and 2009–2011 over the United States and 2014–2015 over China. Results for O3- and PM2.5-based metrics featured minor differences due to the model resolutions considered here (2.0° × 2.5° and 0.5° × 0.666°) and model, meteorology, and emissions inventory each played larger roles in variances. Surface metrics related to O3 were consistently high biased, though to varying degrees, demonstrating the need to evaluate particular modeling frameworks before O3 impacts are quantified. Surface metrics related to PM2.5 were diverse, indicating that a multimodel mean with robust results are valuable tools in predicting PM2.5-related impacts. Oftentimes, the configuration that captured the change of a metric best over time differed from the configuration that captured the magnitude of the same metric best, demonstrating the challenge in skillfully simulating impacts. These results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these models in simulating impact metrics related to air quality and near-term climate. With such information, the reliability of historical and future simulations can be better understood. ©2017. American Geophysical Union.

In this aspect, this study had tried to assess historical landscape changes of afro-alpine forest ecosystem with its respective driving forces and effectiveness of different institutional arrangements to protect this ecosystem. Methods: The study utilized satellite imagery from Landsat series starting from 1986 to 2016, ground truth data from GPS-based field survey, focus group discussions, and reconnaissance field survey. Historical landscape maps were prepared with a mix of supervised and unsupervised image classification methods. Future landscape change simulation was undertaken by using cellular automata modeling on Dynamic Environment for Geoprocessing Objects (Dinamica EGO) software. Beyond areal change and transition of landscape elements, level of ecosystem fragmentation was assessed with FRAGSTAT software. Results: Results have shown that there is encroachment of human-induced land use patterns especially agriculture and grazing while closed canopy forest and woodland ecosystems have decreased in their extent. Simulation outputs for the coming three decades have also shown similar patterns with historical trends. Beyond changes in areal extent, landscape matrix analysis results indicated that there is increasing class and landscape level fragmentation both in its historical and future probable likelihoods. Effectiveness of different management strategies at different institutional arrangement were differ in their effectiveness that federal and regional government were not able to curve landscape change. Conclusions: In conclusion, increasing population pressure and weak policy implementation and legal enforcement has caused threats for alpine forest ecosystem in Bale eco-region.

However, various agricultural practices on farmland carbon sequestration usually have a major impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It is very important to accurately quantify the effect of agricultural practices. This study developed a platform—the Denitrification Decomposition (DNDC) online model—for simulating and evaluating the agricultural carbon sequestration and emission mitigation based on the scientific process of the DNDC model, which is widely used in the simulation of soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. After testing the adaptability of the platform on two sampling fields, it turned out that the simulated values matched the measured values well for crop yields and GHG emissions. We used the platform to estimate the effect of three carbon sequestration practices in a sampling field: nitrogen fertilization reduction, straw residue and midseason drainage. The results indicated the following: (1) moderate decrement of the nitrogen fertilization in the sampling field was able to decrease the N2O emission while maintaining the paddy rice yield; (2) ground straw residue had almost no influence on paddy rice yield, but the CH4 emission and the surface SOC concentration increased along with the quantity of the straw residue; (3) compared to continuous flooding, midseason drainage would not decrease the paddy rice yield and could lead to a drop in CH4 emission. Thus, this study established the DNDC online model, which is able to serve as a reference and support for the study and evaluation of the effects of agricultural practices on agricultural carbon sequestration and GHG emissions mitigation in China. © 2017 by the authors.

The achievement of an affordable and sustainable equilibrium between available water resources and irrigation demand is essentially related to the planning and implementation of evidence-based adaptation strategies and actions. The present study proposed a state-of-the art conceptual framework and computational methodology to assess the potential water scarcity risk, due to changes in climate trends and variability, on irrigated croplands. The model has been tested over the irrigated agriculture of Puglia Region, a semi-arid territory with the largest agricultural production in Southern Italy. The methodology, based on the Regional Risk Assessment (RRA) approach, has been applied within a scenario-based hazard framework. Regional climate projections, under alternative greenhouse gas concentration scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and for two different timeframes, 2021–2050 and 2041–2070 compared to the baseline 1976–2005 period, have been used to drive hydrological simulations of river inflow to the most important reservoirs serving irrigation purposes in Puglia. The novelty of the proposed RRA-based approach does not simply rely on the concept of risk as combination of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, but rather elaborates detailed (scientific and conceptual) framing and computational description of these factors, to produce risk spatial pattern maps and related statistics distinguishing the most critical areas (risk hot spots). The application supported the identification of the most affected areas (i.e. Capitanata Reclamation Consortia under RCP8.5 2041–2070 scenario), crops (fruit trees and vineyards), and, finally, the vulnerability pattern of irrigation systems and networks. The implemented assessment singled out future perspectives of water scarcity risk levels for irrigated agriculture by the administrative extent where individual bodies are in charge of the coordination of public and private irrigation activities (i.e. Reclamation Consortia). Based on the outcomes of the proposed methodology, tailored and knowledge-based adaptation strategies and related actions can be developed, to reduce the risk at both agronomic level (i.e. preferring crops with low vulnerability score, as olive groves) and at structural level (i.e. differentiating the water stocks and supplies and reducing losses and inefficiencies). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Irrigated agriculture; Puglia; Reclamation consortium; Water resources; Water scarcity","Agriculture; Crops; Greenhouse gases; Hazards; Irrigation; Knowledge based systems; Orchards; Reclamation; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Water resources; Computational methodology; Hydrological simulations; Irrigated agriculture; Puglia; Regional climate projections; Regional risk assessment; Risk assessment framework; Water scarcity; Climate change; agricultural production; climate change; crop yield; irrigation; nature-society relations; regional climate; resource scarcity; risk assessment; semiarid region; vulnerability; water availability; water demand; water resource; Italy; Puglia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028965959

In this paper, we used probit regression and post-estimation simulations to identify the key micro (farm specific) and macro (country specific) factors as predictors of MTM adoption in four countries spanning a north-south gradient in eastern and southern Africa (ESA): Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Malawi. We found that farmers’ access to markets and social capital empirically predicted MTM adoption. Policies that increased fertilizer subsidies and extension-staff-to-farmer ratios had similar effects, even if only modestly. Conceivably, subsidies specifically targeted at MTM could also be considered based on their potential environmental and social benefits. We conclude that adoption of MTM still faces the same micro- and macro-level hurdles common to all agricultural technologies. Long-term investments in agricultural extension and reductions in the costs of complementary inputs are critical for the diffusion of MTM. © 2017, The Author(s).","Adoption; Agricultural extension; Conservation agriculture; Input subsidy; Policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021283684

Computational models are often applied in sediment load assessments but their structure inherently includes assumptions and uncertainties, which can hinder their predictive and explanatory capabilities. In this study, a 3D dual-permeability model was applied with field-scale data from a high-latitude site to investigate sediment balances and structural uncertainties in sediment transport components. The two-year data encompassed hourly records of water flow and sediment concentration composite samples from tillage layer runoff and drain discharge in two adjacent clayey fields with different slopes (1% and 5%). Three model structures with different assumptions of sediment transport pathways were built to test their performance against the data. The simulations demonstrated how different model structures can reproduce the data with varying results on sediment balance. The varying results revealed the importance of flow, erosion, and sediment transport observations from the fields to improve the simulations. Structural uncertainty analysis revealed uncertainties which parameter sensitivity analysis could not describe. Concentration data was shown to include more information about erosion and sediment transport processes than solely the load data. The results suggest that a major part (48–69%) of the detached particles remained in the field and that lateral subsurface transport contributed to load generation (10–21% of total loads) especially in the steeper field. The results demonstrated that the majority (84–87%) of sediment loads occurred via subsurface drain discharge and groundwater outflow with the slope gradient of 1–5%, which suggests that load mitigation measures should also be directed to decrease loads via subsurface transport pathways. The simulations demonstrated how transport processes were controlled not only by water flow but also by soil structure. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Erosion; Lateral transport; Preferential flow","Agriculture; Erosion; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Hydraulics; Model structures; Runoff; Salinity measurement; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sensitivity analysis; Soil testing; Uncertainty analysis; Dual permeability model; Erosion and sediment transports; Lateral transport; Parameter sensitivity analysis; Preferential flows; Sediment concentration; Sediment transport pathways; Structural uncertainty; Suspended sediments; assessment method; clay soil; computer simulation; critical load; discharge; preferential flow; runoff; sediment transport; suspended sediment; three-dimensional modeling; uncertainty analysis; water erosion; water flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020896454

Woody biomass cropping provides an opportunity to interlink RE supply with spatial planning goals, RE concepts and rural development programmes since it tackles several issues, ranging from climate or soil protection to over food production and income diversification as well as new and additional regional value cluster. Participatory scenario generation supported by interactive visualization tools facilitates the development of joint goals regarding local land-use decisions. Methods: Based on a stakeholder dialogue in the rural district of Göttingen, two scenarios were quantified and analysed. Reflecting a farmer-oriented economic perspective in (a) “Income first” and an integration of economic and ecological aspects in (b) “Ecological benefits”, the two scenarios address opportunities and constraints of poplar short rotation coppice (SRC) in comparison to three common crop rotations in the case study area. Suitable SRC parcels were determined by linking yield modelling results of annual reference crops and poplar SRC with ecological indicators of water-induced soil erosion and ecotone density as well as with annuity calculation and a risk assessment (stochastic dominance) based on the Monte Carlo simulation of price and yield fluctuation. Results: SRC was economically superior (stochastically first-order dominant) to all three reference crop rotations (oilseed rape-wheat-barley; maize-wheat-maize-wheat; oilseed rape-wheat-wheat) on 1800 ha or 4.9% of the arable land. With a positive annuity difference ranging between 63 and 236€ ha−1 a−1 SRC provides an opportunity to diversify farmers’ income. The primary energy supply from the suitable land parcels accounted for 130 GWh a−1 or 8% of the RE supply in 2030 strived for by local climate protection goals. Around 50% of the 1800 ha are suitable as focal areas for a joint consideration of farmers’ income, erosion protection and structural enrichment. The related average economic trade-off on annuity differences for the gain of substantially increased ecological benefits is about 17€ ha−1 a−1 (13%). Conclusions: Linking ecological criteria assessment with dynamic investment calculation and risk evaluation in a joint methodology revealed that SRC is an economic viable alternative for renewable energy production and can provide ecological synergies in terms of erosion protection and structural enrichment. The presented methodology is transferrable and allows to visualize stakeholder-based scenarios with an agreed identification of opportunities and constraints that come with SRC on arable land. This helps to better integrate local land-use decisions with formal and informal spatial planning goals. © 2017, The Author(s).","Arable land management; Ecological synergies; Economic return; Erosion protection; Landscape assessment; Monte Carlo simulation; Multi-criteria analysis; Scenario generation; Short rotation coppice; Stakeholder dialogue","Agriculture; Crops; Ecology; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Economics; Erosion; Forestry; Intelligent systems; Investments; Monte Carlo methods; Oils and fats; Oilseeds; Regional planning; Risk assessment; Rotation; Rural areas; Soil conservation; Stochastic systems; Visualization; Arable land; Ecological synergies; Economic returns; Erosion protections; Landscape assessments; Multi Criteria Analysis; Scenario generation; Short rotation coppice; Stakeholder dialogue; Land use; arable land; coppice; ecological approach; economic analysis; environmental assessment; erosion control; land management; land use planning; local participation; Monte Carlo analysis; multicriteria analysis; power generation; renewable resource; rural planning; scenario analysis; spatial analysis; stakeholder; trade-off; Germany; Gottingen; Lower Saxony; Brassica napus; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011854086

Previous extension studies might have provided insufficient support to potential users (e.g. policymakers) in finding effective means of operating an agriculture industry in a sustainable manner. This is partly a result of the fact that orthodox positive mathematical programming involves numerous calibration methods that reproduce the original land-area allocation at the reference point, implying that they generate as many simulation results as the number of calibration methods themselves. To have more of an impact, the present study proposed a procedure for using simulation results to determine a calibration method. As an illustration, the proposed procedure was applied to an upland cropping system in Hokkaido, Japan. It was observed that the selected calibration method outperformed the average cost method, the method used most frequently in practice, for the specified dataset. The procedure suggested in the present study proved to be more flexible than previous approaches with respect to the selection process of calibration methods, and it could be regarded as a step toward harmonizing the extended use of life cycle assessment with bioeconomic modelling.

In this work, a potential alternative method for the disposal of chicken manure from Singapore local hen layer farms was studied. Gasification was proposed as the green technology to convert chicken manure into clean energy. Through gasification experiments in a 10 kW fixed bed downdraft gasifier, it was found that chicken manure was indeed a compatible feedstock for gasification in the presence of wood waste. The co-gasification of 30 wt% chicken manure and 70 wt% wood waste produced syngas of comparable quality to that of gasification of pure wood waste, with a syngas lower heating value (LHV) of 5.23 MJ/Nm3 and 4.68 MJ/Nm3, respectively. Furthermore, the capability of the gasification derived biochar in the removal of an emerging contaminant (artificial sweetener such as Acesulfame, Saccharin and Cyclamate) via adsorption was also conducted in the second part of this study. The results showed that the biochar was effective in the removal of the contaminant and the mechanism of adsorption of artificial sweetener by biochar was postulated to be likely via electrostatic interaction as well as specific interaction. Finally, we conducted a cost-benefit analysis for the deployment of a gasification system in a hen layer farm using a Monte Carlo simulation model. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adsorption; Biochar; Chicken manure; Cost-benefit analysis; Emerging contaminants; Gasification","Adsorption; Agriculture; Animals; Calorific value; Fertilizers; Gasification; Manures; Monte Carlo methods; Sugar substitutes; Synthesis gas; Synthesis gas manufacture; Artificial sweeteners; Bio chars; Chicken manure; Emerging contaminant; Environmental issues; Fixed bed downdrafts; Lower heating value; Specific interaction; Cost benefit analysis; adsorption; biogenic material; biomass; charcoal; chemical reaction; cost-benefit analysis; environmental issue; environmental technology; gas production; manure; pollutant; waste disposal; wood; Singapore [Southeast Asia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029783816

Simulations reveal that a relatively strong reduction in PM2.5 levels can be achieved by decreasing agricultural emissions, notably of ammonia (NH3) released from fertilizer use and animal husbandry. The absolute impact on PM2.5 reduction is strongest in East Asia, even for small emission decreases. Conversely, over Europe and North America, aerosol formation is not immediately limited by the availability of ammonia. Nevertheless, reduction of NH3 can also substantially decrease PM2.5 concentrations over the latter regions, especially when emissions are abated systematically. Our results document how reduction of agricultural emissions decreases aerosol pH due to the depletion of aerosol ammonium, which affects particle liquid phase and heterogeneous chemistry. Further, it is shown that a 50% reduction of agricultural emissions could prevent the mortality attributable to air pollution by ∼250000 people yr-1 worldwide, amounting to reductions of 30, 19, 8 and 3% over North America, Europe, East and South Asia, respectively.

Dr Juan Filloy s/n, Ciudad Universitaria, Córdoba, 5000, Argentina","Argentina has been among the world leaders in the production and export of agricultural products since the 1990s. The Carcarañá River Lower Basin (CRLB), a cropland of the Pampas region supplied by extensive rainfall, is located in an area with few streamgauging and other hydrologic/water-quality stations. Therefore, limited hydrologic data are available resulting in limited water-resources assessment. This work explores the application of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to the CRLB in the Santa Fe province of the Pampas region. The analysis of field and remote-sensing data characterizing hydrology, water quality, soil types, land use/land cover, management practices, and crop yield, guarantee a comprehensive SWAT modeling approach. A combined manual and automated calibration and validation process incorporating sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is performed using information concerning interior watershed processes. Eleven N/P fertilizer rates are selected to simulate the impact of N fertilizer on crop yield, plant uptake, as well as runoff and leaching losses. Different indices (partial factor productivity, agronomic efficiency, apparent crop recovery efficiency of applied nutrient, internal utilization efficiency, and physiological efficiency) are considered to assess nitrogen-use efficiency. The overall quality of the fit is satisfactory considering the input data limitations. This work provides, for the first time in Argentina, a reliable tool to simulate yield response to soil quality and water availability capable to meet defined environmental targets to support decision making on planning public policies and private activities on the Pampas region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Crop yield calibration; Fertilizers; Nitrogen use efficiency; Pampas region; SWAT; Ungauged basin","Agricultural products; Agriculture; Calibration; Crops; Decision making; Efficiency; Fertilizers; Land use; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Quality control; Rain; Remote sensing; Soils; Water quality; Water resources; Watersheds; Crop yield; Nitrogen-use efficiency; Pampas region; SWAT; Ungauged basins; Uncertainty analysis; ground water; nitrate; phosphorus; surface water; computer simulation; crop yield; modeling; nitrogen; soil and water assessment tool; soil quality; water availability; watershed; Argentina; Article; calibration; environmental parameters; evapotranspiration; fertilization; harvest; hydrology; land use; maize; precipitation; reliability; simulation; Soil and Water Assessment Tool; soil degradation; soil quality; soybean; validity; water analysis; water availability; water contamination; water quality; water supply; watershed; Argentina; Pampas; Santa Fe [Argentina]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018649995

Climate change projections, anticipated population growth, and continued agricultural intensification, will likely stress existing water supplies in coming decades. Using a state-and-transition simulation modeling approach, we examine a broad suite of spatially explicit future land use scenarios and their associated county-level water use demand out to 2062. We examined a range of potential water demand futures sampled from a 20-year record of historical (1992–2012) data to develop a suite of potential future land change scenarios, including low/high change scenarios for urbanization and agriculture as well as “lowest of the low” and “highest of the high” anthropogenic use. Future water demand decreased 8.3 billion cubic meters (Bm3) in the lowest of the low scenario and decreased 0.8 Bm3 in the low agriculture scenario. The greatest increased water demand was projected for the highest of the high land use scenario (+9.4 Bm3), high agricultural expansion (+4.6 Bm3), and high urbanization (+2.1 Bm3) scenarios. Overall, these scenarios show agricultural land use decisions will likely drive future demand more than increasing municipal and industrial uses, yet improved efficiencies across all sectors could lead to potential water use savings. Results provide water managers with information on diverging land use and water use futures, based on historical, observed land change trends and water use histories. © 2017, Public Library of Science.

Several components must be managed together while they strongly interact spatially. Decision choices must be made under uncertainty on the results of the actions and on the system dynamics. Furthermore, the objectives pursued when managing ecological systems or agroecosys-tems are usually long term objectives, such as biodiversity conservation or sustainable crop production. The framework of Graph-Based Markov Decision Processes (GMDP) is well adapted to the qualitative modeling of such problems of sequential decision under uncertainty. Spatial interactions are easily modeled and integrated control policies (combining several action levers) can be designed through optimization. The provided policies are adaptive, meaning that management actions are decided at each time step (for instance yearly) and the chosen actions depend on the current system state. This framework has already been successfully applied to forest management and invasive species management. However, up to now, no “easy-to-use” implementation of this framework was available. We present GMDPtoolbox, a Matlab toolbox which can be used both for the design of new management policies and for comparing policies by simulation. We provide an illustration of the use of the toolbox on a realistic crop disease management problem: the design of long term management policy of blackleg of canola using an optimal combination of three possible cultural levers. This example shows how GMDPtoolbox can be used as a tool to support expert thinking. © 2017 Cros et al.

Applying the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) to the unconstrained control problems (i.e. without costs of control or resource limitations), we prove that, for all the policies investigated, only bang–bang controls with at most one switch are admitted. When a switch occurs, the optimal strategy is to delay the control action some amount of time and then apply the control at the maximum rate for the remainder of the outbreak. This result is in contrast with previous findings on the unconstrained problems of minimizing the total infectious burden over an outbreak, where the optimal strategy is to use the maximal control for the entire epidemic. Then, the critical consequence of our results is that, in a wide range of epidemiological circumstances, it may be impossible to minimize the total infectious burden while minimizing the epidemic duration, and vice versa. Moreover, numerical simulations highlighted additional unexpected results, showing that the optimal control can be delayed also when the control reproduction number is lower than one and that the switching time from no control to maximum control can even occur after the peak of infection has been reached. Our results are especially important for livestock diseases where the minimization of outbreaks duration is a priority due to sanitary restrictions imposed to farms during ongoing epidemics, such as animal movements and export bans. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Bang–bang control; Delayed intervention; Deterministic epidemic; Infectious disease outbreak; Minimum time; SIR model","Agriculture; Discrete time control systems; Epidemiology; Optimal control systems; Optimal systems; Veterinary medicine; Delayed intervention; Deterministic epidemic; Infectious disease outbreaks; Minimum time; SIR model; Disease control; disease control; disease spread; epidemiology; infectious disease; livestock; numerical method; animal culling; Article; avian influenza; bovine spongiform encephalopathy; disease eradication; Ebolavirus; epidemic; global disease burden; intervention study; livestock; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mortality; nonhuman; numerical simulation; public health; quarantine; sanitation; simulation; stochastic model; susceptible infected recovered epidemic model; threat; vaccination; animal; animal disease; epidemic; human; time factor; transmission; veterinary; Animalia; Animal Culling; Animal Diseases; Animals; Epidemics; Humans; Livestock; Time Factors; Vaccination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027882455

Elicitation of expert opinions combined with multi-criteria assessment (MCA) could be a useful approach for sustainability assessments in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, the validity of expert opinion used to score sustainability performance of agricultural systems, however, has not been addressed. Also, robustness of the overall outcome of MCA to uncertainty about scores obtained from expert elicitation and weights used to aggregate scores is generally not addressed. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the validity of expert opinion, and to evaluate the robustness of the overall MCA outcome to uncertainty about scores and weights. The case study considers three soybean agricultural systems in Latin America: conventional agricultural system, with either genetically modified (GM) or non-genetically modified (non-GM) soybeans, and organic agricultural system. The validation was carried out by comparing the sustainability scores of experts with values from scientific studies. The robustness of the overall outcome of the MCA to uncertainty about scores and weights was assessed using Monte Carlo simulation. The comparison of expert opinion with reviewed studies showed that expert opinions are a potential alternative to extensive data-rich methods. The validity of expert opinions can be increased by considering a larger group of experts, with a high level of knowledge about agricultural systems and sustainability issues. With regard to robustness, the overall outcome of the MCA showed higher variation for organic soybean agricultural systems compared with GM and non-GM, in both Brazil and Argentina. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural systems; Monte Carlo simulation; Multi-criteria assessment; Robustness; Sustainability; Validation","alternative agriculture; expert system; farming system; model validation; Monte Carlo analysis; multicriteria analysis; soybean; sustainability; uncertainty analysis; Argentina; Brazil; Latin America; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025434410

A continuous consumption of polluted water as drinking water or for culinary purposes is by no means a minor hazard for people’s health that must be studied. This research presents a new methodology for the spatial analysis of health risk rate from intake of nitrate-polluted groundwater. The method is illustrated through its application to a water quality sampling campaign performed in the south of Spain in 2003. The probability risk model used by the US Environmental Protection Agency has been applied, considering a residential intake framework and three representative population age groups (10, 40 and 65 years).The method was based upon coupling Monte Carlo simulations and geostatistics, which allowed mapping of the health risk coefficient (RC). The maps obtained were interpreted in the framework of water resources management and user’s health protection (municipalities). The results showed waterborne health risk caused by nitrate-polluted water is moderately low for the region. The observed risk was larger for the elderly and children, although no significant differences were found among the three age groups (RC average values of 95th percentile for age of 0.37, 0.33 and 0.37, respectively).

Since 2014, regulation, consumption, and use of water, especially in agriculture, have been analyzed through policies and fiscal instruments. This research presents itself in the context of the simulation of scenarios using positive mathematical programming, to analyze the economic impact of pricing policies on agro-food farms. Policies of fixed costs, water blocks, and volumetric prices are evaluated. The results show that the existing fixed costs do not reduce water consumption. In contrast, the scenarios of water blocks and volumetric prices impact on the behavior of farmers. The tendency of water consumption to the application of volumetric prices demonstrates that banana farms have a greater tolerance to the increase of water costs. On the other hand, the response to an increase in cost in the case of cacao, sugar cane, and rice depends on the productivity of farmers. The negative effects can lead to the abandonment of agriculture. Thus, volumetric policies are more efficient in reducing water consumption as well as in recovering the costs of the irrigation system. © 2017 by the authors.","Agricultural policy; Economic impact; Irrigated agriculture; PMP; Water consumption","agricultural policy; economic impact; evergreen tree; farm; fiscal policy; herb; institutional reform; irrigation; numerical method; policy analysis; pricing policy; rice; scenario analysis; sugar cane; water economics; water use; Ecuador; Saccharum; Theobroma cacao",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028328529

Both existing grasslands and marginal croplands have been suggested as targets for conversion to switchgrass, but the resulting production potentials and hydrologic impacts are not clear. The objectives of this study were to model switchgrass production on existing grasslands (scenario-I) and on marginal croplands that have severe to very severe limitations for crop production (scenario-II) and to evaluate the effects on evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to the 1063 km2 Skeleton Creek watershed in north-central Oklahoma, a watershed dominated by grasslands (35%) and winter wheat cropland (47%). The simulated average annual yield (2002–2011) for rainfed Alamo switchgrass for both scenarios was 12 Mg ha-1. Yield varied spatially under scenario-I from 6.1 to 15.3 Mg ha-1, while under scenario-II the range was from 8.2 to 13.8 Mg ha-1. Comparison of average annual ET and streamflow between the baseline simulation (existing land use) and scenario-I showed that scenario-I had 5.6% (37 mm) higher average annual ET and 27.7% lower streamflow, representing a 40.7 million m3 yr-1 streamflow reduction. Compared to the baseline, scenario-II had only 0.5% higher ET and 3.2% lower streamflow, but some monthly impacts were larger. In this watershed, the water yield reduction per ton of biomass production (i.e. hydrologic cost-effectiveness ratio) was more than 5X greater under scenario-I than under scenario-II. These results suggest that, from a hydrologic perspective, it may be preferable to convert marginal cropland to switchgrass production rather than converting existing grasslands. © 2017, Public Library of Science.

Climate variability represents an uncertainty factor in crop production. Considering yield impact, climatic influence is perceived during and evaluated at the end of crop production cycles. In practice, this information is then incorporated into planning for the upcoming season. This process contributes to attitudes toward climate-induced risk in crop production. In the literature, however, the subjective valuation of risk is modeled as a risk attitude toward variations in (monetary) outcomes. Consequently, climatic influence may be obscured by political and market influences so that risk perceptions during the production process are neglected. We present a utility concept that allows the inclusion of annual risk scores based on mid-season risk perceptions that are incorporated into field-planning decisions. This approach is exemplified and implemented for winter wheat production in the Kraichgau, a region in Southwest Germany, using the integrated bio-economic simulation model FARMACTOR and empirical data from the region. Survey results indicate that a profitability threshold for this crop, the level of “still-good yield” (sgy), is 69 dt ha-1 (regional mean Kraichgau sample) for a given season. This threshold governs the monitoring process and risk estimators. We tested the modeled estimators against simulation results using ten projected future weather time series for winter wheat production. The mid-season estimators generally proved to be effective. This approach can be used to improve the modeling of planning decisions by providing a more comprehensive evaluation of field-crop response to climatic changes from an economic risk point of view. The methodology further provides economic insight in an agrometeorological context where prices for crops or inputs are lacking, but farmer attitudes toward risk should still be included in the analysis. © 2017 Reinmuth et al.

Recent progress in both crop modeling and Decision Support Systems (DSS) applied to viticulture promises important changes that combine both high quality production and environmental sustainability. However, most of this progress is only addressed at the farm level and does not challenge the viticulture landscape, which is a key issue when facing DOC, DOCG areas, wine growers' cooperatives and consortiums and strategic viticulture planning. Thus, this paper aims to demonstrate that a new type of DSS, which is developed on a Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure (GCI) platform, may provide an important web-based operational tool for high quality viticulture as it connects farm and landscape levels better. The GCI platform supports acquisition, management, processing of both static and dynamic data (e.g. pedological, daily climatic, and vineyard distribution), data visualization, and on-the-fly computer applications in order to perform simulation modeling (e.g. grapevine water stress, evaluation of ecosystem services, etc.). These are all potentially accessible via the Web. This is possible thanks to the implementation of a set of modeling clusters that is strongly rooted in soil-plant-atmosphere and physically based simulation modeling. The DSS tool, applied to an area of 20,000 ha in Southern Italy, is designed to address viticulture planning and management by providing operational support for farmers, farmer associations and decision makers involved in the viticulture landscape. Output of the system includes viticulture planning and management scenario analysis, maps and evaluation of potential and current plant water stress. The tool will also be demonstrated through a short selection of practical case studies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","GeoVit; Modeling; Simulation; Spatial decision support system; Viticulture","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Data visualization; Decision making; Ecosystems; Models; Plants (botany); Sustainable development; Wine; Cyber infrastructures; Decision support system (dss); Environmental sustainability; GeoVit; Physically-based simulation; Simulation; Spatial decision support systems; Viticulture; Decision support systems; agricultural technology; decision making; decision support system; numerical model; simulation; sustainability; visualization; viticulture; water stress; Italy; Vitis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020286702

However, it is challenging to implement the agriculture monitoring network in large scale and large distributed area. Typically, a large and dense network as a form of multihop network is used to establish communication between source and destination. This network continuously monitors the crops without sensitivity classification that can lead to message collision and packets drop. Retransmissions of drop messages can increase the energy consumption and delay. Therefore, to ensure a high quality of service (QoS), we propose an agriculture monitoring network that monitors the crops based on their sensitivity conditions wherein the crops with higher sensitivity are monitored constantly, while less sensitive crops are monitored occasionally.This approach selects a set of nodes rather than utilizing all the nodes in the network which reduces the power consumption in each node and network delay. The QoS of the proposed classified based approach is compared with the nonclassified approach in two scenarios; the backoff periods are changed in the first scenario while the numbers of nodes are changed in the second scenario. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the nonclassified approach on different test scenarios. © 2017 Ismail Ahmedy et al.",,"Agriculture; Crops; Drops; Energy utilization; Quality of service; Sensor nodes; Agriculture monitoring; Dense network; Multihop networks; Network delays; Network modeling; Retransmissions; Sensitivity classification; Test scenario; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025449053

However, agriculture is highly heterogeneous across the country owing to regional disparities in exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. It is essential to know and quantify the possible impacts of changes in climate on crop yield for successful agricultural management and planning at a local scale. The Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2-Earth System (HadGEM-ES) was employed to generate regional climate projections for the study area using the Regional Climate Model (RCM) RegCM4.4. The dynamics in potential impacts at the sub-district level were evaluated using the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCPs). The aim of this study was to simulate the crop yield under a plausible change in climate for the coastal areas of South India through the end of this century. The crop simulation model, the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) 4.5, was used to understand the plausible impacts on the major crop yields of rice, groundnuts, and sugarcane under the RCP 4.5 trajectory. The findings reveal that under the RCP 4.5 scenario there will be decreases in the major C3 and C4 crop yields in the study area. This would affect not only the local food security, but the livelihood security as well. This necessitates timely planning to achieve sustainable crop productivity and livelihood security. On the other hand, this situation warrants appropriate adaptations and policy intervention at the sub-district level for achieving sustainable crop productivity in the future. © 2017 A et al.

To assess the comprehensive impacts of these changes on food security and environmental sustainability, and establish effective and environment-friendly subsidy policies, this research constructed an agent-based model (ABM). Daligang Town, which is located in the two-season rice region of Southern China, was selected as the case study site. Four different policy scenarios, i.e., “sharply increasing” (SI), “no-increase” (NI), “adjusted-method” (AM), and “trend” (TD) scenarios were investigated from 2015 to 2029. The validation result shows that the relative prediction errors between the simulated and actual values annually ranged from −20 to 20%, indicating the reliability of the proposed model. The scenario analysis revealed that the four scenarios generated different variations in cropping systems, rice yield, and fertilizer and pesticide inputs when the purchase price of rice and the non-agricultural income were assumed to increase annually by 0.1 RMB per kg and 10% per person, respectively. Among the four different policy scenarios in Daligang, the TD scenario was considered the best, because it had a relatively high rice yield, fairly minimal use of fertilizers and pesticides, and a lower level of subsidy. Despite its limitations, ABM could be considered a useful tool in analyzing, exploring, and discussing the comprehensive effects of the changes in farming system on food security and environmental sustainability. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","ABM; Environmental sustainability; Farming systems; Food security; Southern China","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Economics; Environmental protection; Fertilizers; Food supply; Pesticides; Agent-based model; Comprehensive effect; Environment friendly; Environmental sustainability; Farming system; Food security; Southern China; Validation results; Sustainable development; fertilizer; pesticide; fertilizer; pesticide; environmental impact assessment; farming system; food security; numerical model; rural area; subsidy system; sustainability; agricultural worker; Article; calculation; China; Chinese; controlled study; cropping system; decision making; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; environmental sustainability; farming system; food security; human; income; plant yield; prediction; reliability; rural area; simulation; agriculture; catering service; environment; environmental monitoring; Oryza; policy; procedures; reproducibility; rural population; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; China; Agriculture; China; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Policy; Fertilizers; Food Supply; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Oryza; Pesticides; Policy; Reproducibility of Results; Rural Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020447661

The scenarios used in higher tier FOCUS simulations were mainly based on Central/North European, and work is needed to underpin the validity of simulated exposure profiles for Mediterranean agroecosystems. In addition, the RA of chemicals are traditionally evaluated on the basis of single substances although freshwater life is generally exposed to a multitude of pesticides. In the present study, we monitored 19 pesticides in surface waters of five locations in the Portuguese ‘Lezíria do Tejo’ agricultural area. FOCUS step 3 simulations were performed for the South European scenarios to estimate predicted environmental concentrations (PECs). We verified that 44% of the PECs underestimated the measured environmental concentrations (MEC) of the pesticides, showing a non-compliance with the field data. Risk was assessed by comparing the environmental quality standards (EQS) and regulatory acceptable concentrations with their respective MECs. Risk of mixtures was demonstrated in 100% of the samples with insecticides accounting for 60% of the total risk identified. The overall link between the RA and the actual situation in the field must be considerably strengthened, and field studies on pesticide exposure and effects should be carried out to assist the improvement of predictive approaches used for regulatory purposes. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","FOCUSsw; Mediterranean surface waters; Modelling; Pesticide mixtures; Risk assessment","agricultural ecosystem; concentration (composition); environmental quality; Mediterranean environment; model validation; performance assessment; pesticide; prediction; regulatory framework; risk assessment; surface water; Portugal; pesticide; water; agriculture; risk assessment; water pollutant; Agriculture; Pesticides; Risk Assessment; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020256746

Existing literature, however, often focuses on single measures without considering that policies are usually bundles of different measures addressing multiple non-marketed goods and services. Thus, interaction effects of a set of policies in a given policy mix may influence the cost-effectiveness of single measures. Recently, Swiss agricultural policy was redesigned using the Tinbergen rule as its basis, i.e., a single measure for each policy goal, including additional targeted direct payments. This facilitates testing for interaction effects of multiple targeted AEMs. Here we use a social-ecological, agent-based modelling framework to assess interaction effects of these agricultural policies while accounting for climate change impacts in our analysis. The results from our case study in a mountain region show that ecosystem service provision increases with targeted payments. However, interaction effects of the different targeted policies affect the provision levels of all goods and services. In particular, changes at the extensive margin, i.e., the total amount of land that is under production, largely determine the amount of ecosystem services provided. Thus, climate change driven productivity increases and policies that keep land in production may substantially support the provision of non-marketed goods and services in marginal agricultural production regions with a high potential for land abandonment. Consequently, the effectiveness of targeted policy measures should also consider changes at the extensive margin and be assessed in the context of bundles or portfolios of different policy measures. © 2017","Agent-based modelling; Agri-environmental measures; Biodiversity conservation; Ecosystem services; Mountain region; Non-marketed goods and services; Targeting","agricultural policy; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; computer simulation; ecosystem service; mountain; targeting; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018763019

Alternatively, algae could play an important role in agriculture where they can be used as biofertilizers and soil stabilizers. To examine the possible reuse of the detritus generated by dead algae as fertilizer for crops, we develop three mathematical models building upon each other. A system is proposed in which algae recover waste nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) for reuse in agricultural production. The results of our study show that in so doing, the crop yield may be increased and simultaneously the density of algae in the lake may be reduced. This could be a way to mitigate and possibly solve the environmental and economic issues nowadays facing agriculture. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Agriculture; Algae biomass; Algae cultivation; Fertilizer; Mathematical model","nitrogen; phosphorus; sulfur; fertilizer; agriculture; alga; algal growth; Article; decomposition; density; detritus; eutrophication; fertilizer application; harvest; mathematical analysis; mathematical computing; mathematical model; numerical simulation; population dynamics; priority journal; recycling; risk reduction; simulation; soil fertility; waste component removal; eutrophication; theoretical model; Agriculture; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019685462

This paper focuses on the water-agriculture-environment nexus in the Murrumbidgee River Basin, Australia, and attempts to explain how reduced water allocation to agriculture aimed at protecting the environment in turn impacted the wider economy and the community. Predictably reduced water allocation saw declines in agriculture production and employment. Despite this, paradoxically, the basin unemployment rate declined and basin median household income increased. To understand and interpret this, we first analyze available labour, economic and hydrology data, and then develop a simple dynamic model to interpret the observed pattern of basin employment and unemployment. Data analysis revealed the likely causes behind the paradox as (a) out-migration of people from the basin, and (b) absorption of the labour force in the fast growing non-agricultural sectors of the diversified basin economy. The model simulations reinforced this interpretation. Further model simulations under alternative realities of out-migration and sectoral transformation indicated that basins embedded in faster growing national economies, and are more diversified to begin with, are likely to be more conducive to agriculture sector reform (e.g., reduced water allocation) and environmental regeneration. This is a sobering message for other regions experiencing environmental degradation due to extensive agricultural development. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Diversified economy; Environmental water allocation; Migration; Socio-hydrology; Unemployment","absorption; agricultural ecosystem; economic analysis; environmental degradation; household income; hydrology; resource allocation; unemployment; Australia; Murrumbidgee Basin; New South Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013808746

A baseline-altered method was used in which the simulation period 1990–2013 was divided into 4 equal periods to represent baseline conditions (1990–1995) and altered land use conditions (1996–2001, 2002–2007, and 2008–2013). Land use maps for 1994, 2000, 2006, and 2013 were acquired from satellite images. A Soil Water Assessment Tool model was calibrated for the baseline period and applied to the altered periods with and without land use change. Incorporating land use change resulted in a Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.7 compared to 0.6 when land use change is ignored. In addition, the model performance for simulations without land use change gradually decreased with time. Land use change appeared to be the important driver for changes in the water balance. The main land use changes during 1994–2013 are a decrease in forest area from 48.7% to 16.9%, an increase in agriculture area from 39.2% to 45.4%, and an increase in settlement area from 9.8% to 34.3%. For the catchment, this resulted in an increase of the runoff coefficient from 35.7% to 44.6% and a decrease in the ratio of evapotranspiration to rainfall from 60% to 54.8%. More pronounced changes can be observed for the ratio of surface runoff to stream flow (increase from 26.6% to 37.5%) and the ratio of base flow to stream flow (decrease from 40% to 31.1%), whereas changes in the ratio of lateral flow to stream flow were minor (decrease from 33.4% to 31.4%). At sub-catchment level, the effect of land use changes on the water balance varied in different sub-catchments depending on the scale of changes in forest and settlement area.

NPV does not account for key uncertainties likely to influence relevant landholder decision making. While real options analysis (ROA) is an alternative method that accounts for the uncertainty over future conditions and the large upfront irreversible investment involved in establishing perennials, there have been limited applications of ROA to evaluating land use change decision economics and even fewer applications considering climate change risks. Further, while the influence of spatially varying climate risk on biomass conversion economic has been widely evaluated using NPV methods, effects of spatial variability and climate on land use change have been scarcely assessed with ROA. In this study we applied a simulation-based ROA model to evaluate a landholder's decision to convert land from agriculture to biomass. This spatially explicit model considers price and yield risks under baseline climate and two climate change scenarios over a geographically diverse farming region. We found that underlying variability in primary productivity across the study area had a substantial effect on conversion thresholds required to trigger land use change when compared to results from NPV analysis. Areas traditionally thought of as being quite similar in average productive capacity can display large differences in response to the inclusion of production and price risks. The effects of climate change, broadly reduced returns required for land use change to biomass in low and medium rainfall zones and increased them in higher rainfall areas. Additionally, the risks posed by climate change can further exacerbate the tendency for NPV methods to underestimate true conversion thresholds. Our results show that even under severe drying and warming where crop yield variability is more affected than perennial biomass plantings, comparatively little of the study area is economically viable for conversion to biomass under $200/DM t, and it is not until prices exceed $200/DM t that significant areas become profitable for biomass plantings. We conclude that for biomass to become a valuable diversification option the synchronisation of products and services derived from biomass and the development of markets is vital. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Australia; Biomass; Climate change; Economic; Real options analysis; Spatial","rain; agricultural land; biomass power; climate change; contingent valuation; decision making; energy market; environmental economics; investment; land use change; landholding; risk assessment; semiarid region; spatial analysis; agricultural land; Article; Australia; biomass conversion; biomass energy; biomass production; climate change; environmental economics; harvest; investment; land use; landscape; nonhuman; profit; renewable energy; risk assessment; simulation; warming; wheat; agriculture; biomass; climate; spatial analysis; Australia; Nucleopolyhedrovirus; Agriculture; Biomass; Climate; Climate Change; Spatial Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012293098

As farm incomes, in Norway and elsewhere, greatly depend on government subsidies, the risk of a policy change constitutes an additional uncertainty source. Hence, climate and policy uncertainty could substantially impact agricultural production and farm income. However, these sources of uncertainty have, so far, rarely been combined in food production analyses. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a combination of policy and climate uncertainty on agricultural production, land use, and social welfare in Norway. Output yield distributions of spring wheat and timothy, a major forage grass, from simulations with the weather-driven crop models, CSM-CERES-Wheat and, LINGRA, were processed in the a stochastic version Jordmod, a price-endogenous spatial economic sector model of the Norwegian agriculture. To account for potential effects of climate uncertainty within a given future greenhouse gas emission scenario on farm profitability, effects on conditions that represented the projected climate for 2050 under the emission scenario A1B from the 4th assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and four Global Climate Models (GCM) was investigated. The uncertainty about the level of payment rates at the time farmers make their management decisions was handled by varying the distribution of payment rates applied in the Jordmod model. These changes were based on the change in the overall level of agricultural support in the past. Three uncertainty scenarios were developed and tested: one with climate change uncertainty, another with payment rate uncertainty, and a third where both types of uncertainty were combined. The three scenarios were compared with results from a deterministic scenario where crop yields and payment rates were constant. Climate change resulted in on average 9% lower cereal production, unchanged grass production and more volatile crop yield as well as 4% higher farm incomes on average compared to the deterministic scenario. The scenario with a combination of climate change and policy uncertainty increased the mean farm income more than a scenario with only one source of uncertainty. On the other hand, land use and farm labour were negatively affected under these conditions compared to the deterministic case. Highlighting the potential influence of climate change and policy uncertainty on the performance of the farm sector our results underline the potential error in neglecting either of these two uncertainties in studies of agricultural production, land use and welfare. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Climate change; CSM-CERES-Wheat; DSSAT; LINGRA; Modelling; Norway; Policy uncertainty","agricultural management; agricultural modeling; agricultural production; cereal; climate change; crop yield; food production; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; land use; policy analysis; profitability; uncertainty analysis; wheat; Norway; Phleum pratense; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011878191

Accordingly, this research aims at analyzing the trend of convergence study on space information based on unmanned aerial vehicles as the study on their global trend. In this study, it was examined by analyzing main key words of the research theses published in international journals last 7 years (2010–2016) using the text mining technique. The analysis results showed that the number of convergence study last 7 years has been rapidly increasing by 61% every year on average. As for its fields, the utilizable technology in the area of Geography–Topography and Agriculture–Forestry–Vegetation was proved to be at the growing stage for qualitative improvement, and that in the area of Architecture–Civil Engineering and Disaster was found to be at the beginning stage in the level of simulation. This research is expected to be applied a lot to the deduction of vacant technology in the areas using unmanned aerial vehicles and to the establishment of the promotional goals of related study by offering the basic data about the trend of use. © 2017, Korean Spatial Information Society.","Convergence research; Spatial information; Text mining; UAV",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065137463

Apart from its acknowledged social benefits, urban farming is also widely viewed as a more resource-efficient alternative to conventional remote farming. Especially indoor, soilless cultivation in urban areas is being portrayed as a particularly sustainable solution. However, as this technique relies on controlled environments, its ongoing operation can be quite energy-intensive and related carbon emissions should be carefully weighed against reduced emissions, such as those from transportation. To further this goal, this article presents a simulation-based environmental analysis workflow for Building-Integrated Agriculture (BIA) in urban contexts, that includes detailed solar radiation, water and energy specific models. The aim of the workflow is to guide the user through decision-making on the potentialities of implementing BIA in a given neighborhood while maximizing crop yields and minimizing water and energy consumption. The workflow was applied to three hi-tech urban farming scenarios in Lisbon, Portugal: a polycarbonate Rooftop Greenhouse (RG), a Vertical Farm (VF) with windows and skylights on the top floor of a reinforced-concrete building as well as a completely opaque VF with no penetration of natural light on the ground floor of a reinforced-concrete building. Global Warming Potential (GWP) related to water, transportation and operational energy of these three case studies were compared to GWP of (i) the currently existing supply chain for tomato, and (ii) a hypothetical low-tech unconditioned rooftop urban farm. Results show that the RG and the top floor VF had the best overall environmental performance, respectively cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half and in three in comparison with the existing supply chain for tomato. By allowing this preliminary assessment of alternative farm locations and properties, the workflow provides the user with actionable information for early-stage holistic assessment of BIA projects. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Building-Integrated Agriculture (BIA); Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA); Global Warming Potential (GWP); Parametric simulation; Performance-based design; Resource efficiency","Agriculture; Buildings; Carbon; Concrete buildings; Concretes; Cultivation; Decision making; Decision support systems; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Floors; Fruits; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Reinforced concrete; Structural design; Supply chains; Building integrated; Controlled environment agricultures; Global warming potential; Parametric simulations; Performance based design; Resource efficiencies; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013837289

This represents approximately 2.1 billion liters of ethanol and 600 million liters of biodiesel requirement per year, which would reduce GHG emissions by more than four million tones. Canada is expected to consume more fuel ethanol compared to its production capacity. The above mandates as well as the gap in consumption and production of biofuel will have enormous impact on the Canadian economy. In this backdrop, an input–output model of the Canadian economy is developed to estimate the macroeconomic impact of the ethanol and biodiesel production in Canada. The impacts on sectoral prices have also been calculated. Simulation exercises have been attempted to reach the mandates using modified Leontief model. Results show that agriculture sector is affected because of feedstock use in the biofuel sector. Mining and manufacturing industries also show a considerable impact.

This has direct impacts on the resilience and performance of the energy and food industries, as water plays a key role in electricity generation processes and agriculture production. Water, energy and food dependencies are more evident in transboundary river basins where several countries share the same source of water for irrigation demand and energy production. From the perspective of the upstream users, it would be ideal to store the water for hydropower generation and the agriculture sector while protecting the environment, whereas the downstream users need the supply of water for their agricultural growth and municipal requirements. We aim to develop a system thinking study by focusing on the transboundary Blue Nile River basin where the Ethiopian government investment in the Grand Renaissance dam has led to opposition by downstream users due to potential reduction of water resource availability downstream. We propose a system thinking approach for analysing different water management practices that considers all the available resources and the requirements set by all the users. To simulate this interaction, we use system dynamics to model the linkage between food production, water abstraction and energy generation. We link the simulation model to an optimisation engine to achieve effective management of the reservoir’s operation. The study provides a platform to investigate how the reservoir operating policies can improve an understanding of the value of water in its alternative uses, and shows how different optimal reservoir release rules generate different optimal solutions inherently involved in upstream and downstream users’ requirements. The proposed methodology is an attempt to enable Nile riparian countries to make more informed decisions on water resources policy and management. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Environmental system thinking; Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam; Nile River; Optimisation; System dynamics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027369967

Nonetheless, partly because of difficulties in obtaining data, there is less literature on measurement error problems than on other endogeneity problems. This article examines estimation bias in the price elasticity of groundwater consumption for irrigated agriculture on the intensive margin. The price at issue is for the energy used in pumping and pressurizing water for delivery. Lacking the precise unit irrigation cost, previous studies imputed irrigation costs. We first consider groundwater irrigation costs and identify factors that can cause measurement errors in the process of imputation under incomplete information about the determinants of irrigation costs. We follow this by systematically analyzing the potential bias caused by measurement errors, using econometric theory along with Monte Carlo simulations where appropriate. We then quantify actual measurement errors, making use of a unique dataset in which energy and groundwater consumption data are matched for individual observations. Finally, we compare regression results using exact irrigation costs as opposed to imputed ones. We find evidence of substantial measurement errors resulting in attenuation and amplification bias in the price elasticity of irrigation water consumption on the intensive margin. Our results indicate that measurement errors in irrigation costs can lead to misleading policy implications related to water and energy pricing as a tool to conserve water. We also show that estimating the energy price elasticity of groundwater use is not as straightforward as previously thought. © The Authors 2017.","Energy; Groundwater; Measurement error; Price elasticity","cost analysis; demand elasticity; energy use; error analysis; groundwater resource; irrigation; measurement method; Monte Carlo analysis; price dynamics; water demand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018946018

The reliance on rain-fed agriculture by over 65% of the population means that vulnerability to climatic hazards such as droughts, rainstorms and floods will continue. Yet, the vulnerability and risk levels faced by different rural social-ecological systems (SES) affected by multiple hazards are poorly understood. To fill this gap, this study quantifies risk and vulnerability of rural communities to drought and floods. Risk is assessed using an indicator-based approach. A stepwise methodology is followed that combines participatory approaches with statistical, remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques to develop community level vulnerability indices in three watersheds (Dano, Burkina Faso; Dassari, Benin; Vea, Ghana). The results show varying levels of risk profiles across the three watersheds. Statistically significant high levels of mean risk in the Dano area of Burkina Faso are found whilst communities in the Dassari area of Benin show low mean risk. The high risk in the Dano area results from, among other factors, underlying high exposure to droughts and rainstorms, longer dry season duration, low caloric intake per capita, and poor local institutions. The study introduces the concept of community impact score (CIS) to validate the indicator-based risk and vulnerability modelling. The CIS measures the cumulative impact of the occurrence of multiple hazards over five years. 65.3% of the variance in observed impact of hazards/CIS was explained by the risk models and communities with high simulated disaster risk generally follow areas with high observed disaster impacts. Results from this study will help disaster managers to better understand disaster risk and develop appropriate, inclusive and well integrated mitigation and adaptation plans at the local level. It fulfills the increasing need to balance global/regional assessments with community level assessments where major decisions against risk are actually taken and implemented. © 2017 Asare-Kyei et al.

Based on scenarios in the 2050s, the biggest loss for maize yields per hectare for the full sample accounts for about one-tenth of the mean maize yield from 2004 to 2010, and all of the villages are impacted. Hence, it is important to help farms adopt an adaptation strategy to tackle the risk of loss for maize yields from climate change, and it is necessary to develop agricultural synthesis services as a public adaptation policy at the village level to interact with the adaptation strategy at the farm level. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Marginal impact; Scenarios of Representative Concentration Pathways; Simulated impact; Statistical model","Agriculture; Climate models; Rural areas; Adaptation strategies; Coupled general circulation models; Interdisciplinary research; Marginal impact; Meteorological research institutes; Scenarios of Representative Concentration Pathways; Simulated impact; Statistical modeling; Climate change; assessment method; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; maize; altitude; Article; China; climate change; environmental impact; environmental temperature; evolutionary adaptation; growing season; irrigation (agriculture); longitude; maize; nonhuman; plant yield; precipitation; agricultural land; agricultural worker; article; China; global climate; human; interdisciplinary research; latitude; simulation; synthesis; warming; weather; China; Hebei; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008442854

Along with rainfall erosivity, soil coverage by vegetation or crop residues is the most dynamic factor affecting soil erosion. Parcel-specific soil coverage information can be derived by satellite imagery with high geometric resolution. However, their usable number is mostly, due to cloud cover, not representative for the phenological characteristics of vegetated classes. To overcome temporal constraints, spatial and temporal fusion models, such as STARFM, are increasingly applied to derive high-resolution time series of remotely sensed biophysical parameters, based on fine spatial/coarse temporal resolution imagery, such as Landsat, and coarse spatial/fine temporal resolution imagery, such as MODIS. In this context, the current study introduces an evaluation scheme for simulated vegetation index time series which enables the assessment of their performance during multiple phenological phases. The evaluation scheme is based on Germany-wide available spatial predictions of phenological phases as well as RapidEye imagery and parcel-specific crop-type information. The evaluation results show that the simulation accuracy is basically controlled by the temporal distance between MODIS and Landsat base pairs, as well as the ability of the actual Landsat image to properly represent the phenological phase of the Landsat image simulated by MODIS. In addition, we discuss the potential of simulated index times series and corresponding phenological information for the dynamic (1) definition of temporal windows where soils are potentially covered by no, sparse or dense vegetation or crop residues and (2) parameterization of soil erosion models. The database thus obtained opens up new possibilities for an efficient and dynamic erosion monitoring, which can support soil protection and hazard prevention. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Monitoring; NDVI; Phenology; Soil cover; Soil erosion; STARFM",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84998717652

However, it is unclear whether farmers realize these benefits when crop choices available to farmers have different and variable costs and returns; multiple countries have programs that incentivize production of certain crops while other crops are subject to market fluctuations. We hypothesize that the benefits of forecasts on farmer livelihoods will be moderated by the combined impact of differing crop economics and changing climate. Drawing upon methods and insights from both physical and social sciences, we develop a model of farmer decision-making to evaluate this hypothesis. The model dynamics are explored using empirical data from Sri Lanka; primary sources include survey and interview information as well as game-based experiments conducted with farmers in the field. Our simulations show that a farmer using seasonal forecasts has more diversified crop selections, which drive increases in average agricultural income. Increases in income are particularly notable under a drier climate scenario, when a farmer using seasonal forecasts is more likely to plant onions, a crop with higher possible returns. Our results indicate that, when water resources are scarce (i.e. drier climate scenario), farmer incomes could become stratified, potentially compounding existing disparities in farmers' financial and technical abilities to use forecasts to inform their crop selections. This analysis highlights that while programs that promote production of certain crops may ensure food security in the short-term, the long-term implications of these dynamics need careful evaluation. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","agriculture systems; climate change adaptation; coupled natural and human systems; farmers; laboratory in the field games; system dynamics model; weather forecasts","Agriculture; Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Decision making; Digital storage; Food supply; Forecasting; Water resources; Agriculture systems; Climate change adaptation; farmers; Human system; System dynamics model; Weather forecasting; agricultural economics; agricultural modeling; climate change; decision making; empirical analysis; farmers knowledge; food security; hypothesis testing; incentive; laboratory method; livelihood; nature-society relations; weather forecasting; Sri Lanka",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015234016

Process-based dynamic growth models are important tools to estimate crop yields based on minimum inputs of climate, soil, crop management, and crop cultivar parameters. Using region-specific cultivar parameters is critical when applying crop models at a global scale because cultivars vary in response to climate conditions, soils, and crop management. In this study, parameters were developed for modern cultivars representing all 17 CIMMYT wheat Mega Environments (MEs) using field experimental data and genetic cultivar relationships for the CROPSIM-CERES model in DSSAT v 4.5 (Decision-Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer). Cultivar performance was tested with independent CIMMYT breeding trial field experiments across several locations. Then crop simulations were carried out at 0.5 × 0.5 ° pixels for global wheat-growing areas, using cultivars representing MEs, soil information, region-specific crop management, and initial soil conditions. Aggregated simulated wheat yields and production were compared to reported country yields and production from Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) statistics, resulting in a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.3 t/ha for yield and 2.2 M t/country for country production. Some of the simulated errors are relatively large at country level because of uncertainties in pixel information for climate, soil, and crop management input and partly because of crop model uncertainties. In addition, FAO yield statistics have uncertainties because of incomplete farm reports or poor estimates. Nevertheless, this new cultivar-specific, partially-validated global baseline simulation enables new studies on issues of food security, agricultural technology, and breeding advancement impacts combined with climate change at a global scale. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","CROPSIM-CERES; DSSAT; Geo-spatial crop modeling; Global wheat production; GRASS","agricultural management; agricultural modeling; agrometeorology; baseline conditions; climate change; crop production; crop yield; cultivar; food security; food supply; selective breeding; wheat; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999634748

We address it by focusing on the performance of the 802.15.4 communication protocol because the IEEE 802.15.4 Standard is actually considered as one of the reference technologies in WSNs. In this paper, we propose to control the sustainable use of resources (i.e., energy consumption, reliability and timely packet transmission) of a wireless sensor node equipped with photovoltaic cells by an adaptive tuning not only of the MAC (Medium Access Control) parameters but also of the sampling frequency of the node. To do this, we use one of the existing control approaches, namely the viability theory, which aims to preserve the functions and the controls of a dynamic system in a set of desirable states. So, an analytical model, describing the evolution over time of nodal resources, is derived and used by a viability algorithm for the adaptive tuning of the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol. The simulation analysis shows that our solution allows ensuring indefinitely, in the absence of hardware failure, the operations (lifetime duration, reliability and timely packet transmission) of an 802.15.4 WSN and one can temporarily increase the sampling frequency of the node beyond the regular sampling one. This latter brings advantages for agricultural and environmental applications such as precision agriculture, flood or fire prevention. Main results show that our current approach enable to send more information when critical events occur without the node runs out of energy. Finally, we argue that our approach is generic and can be applied to other types of WSN. © 2017 Kone et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"algorithm; Article; communication protocol; computer; device failure; energy consumption; energy resource; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; human; process optimization; reliability; sensor; simulation; solar energy; solar radiation; wireless communication; wireless sensor node; computer; computer network; computer simulation; devices; physical phenomena; wireless communication; Algorithms; Computer Communication Networks; Computer Simulation; Computers; Physical Phenomena; Wireless Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014009036

This was achieved by inversely modeling long-term SOC data obtained from 10 experimental sites where corn, soybean, or wheat were grown with a range of tillage, fertilization, and organic matter additions. Inverse modeling was accomplished using a surrogate model for CENTURY's SOC dynamics sub-model wherein mass balance and decomposition kinetics equations from CENTURY are coded and solved by using a nonlinear regression routine of a standard statistical software package. With this approach we generated statistics of CENTURY parameters that are associated with the effects of N fertilization and organic amendment on SOC decay, which are not as well quantified as those of tillage, and initial status of SOC. The results showed that the fit between simulated and observed SOC prior to inverse modeling (R2 = 0.41) can be improved to R2 = 0.84 mainly by increasing the rate of SOC decay up to 1.5 fold for the year in which N fertilizer application rates are over 200 kg N ha-1 . We also observed positive relationships between C inputs and the rate of SOC decay, indicating that the structure of CENTURY, and therefore model accuracy, could be improved by representing SOC decay as Michaelis-Menten kinetics rather than first-order kinetics. Finally, calibration of initial status of SOC against observed levels allowed us to account for site history, confirming that values should be adjusted to account for soil condition during model initialization. Future research should apply this inverse modeling approach to explore how C input rates and N abundance interact to alter SOC decay rates using C inputs made in various forms over a wider range of rates. © 2017 Kwon et al.

The objective of this paper is to use an integrated SD-CLUE-S and InVEST model to simulate and predict land-use changes impacts during 2000-2018 on carbon storage at pixel and regional scales in the Zhangye oasis, Northwest China. The SD-CLUE-S model was used to simulate land-use change, and three land-use scenarios (current trend, moderate protection, and strict protection) were defined in collaboration with oasis socioeconomic development and ecological environment conservation by local government. The InVEST model was then used to simulate land-use change impacts on carbon storage at different scales in the oasis. The results showed that: (1) the effects of built-up land expansion were especially notable, with a rapid decrease in cropland during 2009-2018; (2) the strict protection scenario saved the largest amount of carbon storage for the oasis compared with the current trend and moderate protection scenarios. The scientific value of this study has been to show that the proposed modeling method can be used to reflect different land-use patterns and their effects on ecosystem services at multiple scales in the oasis. Furthermore, this research can be used to help government managers encourage stakeholders to contribute funds and strategies to maintain oasis landscape patterns and ecological processes by implementing local plans for potential conservation projects. © 2017 Liang et al.

Understanding which farming options will give the highest return on investment in light of climate change is critical information for decision-making. While there is continued investment in testing adaptation options using on-farm experiments, simulation models remain important tools for ‘ex-ante’ assessments of the impacts of proposed climate-smart agricultural technologies (CSA). This study used the Ruminant model and the Trade-offs Analysis model for Multi-Dimensional Impact Assessment (TOA-MD) to assess how improved livestock management options affect the three pillars of CSA: increased productivity, improved food security, and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our sample was stratified into: 1) households with local cow breeds (n = 28); 2) households with improved dairy cow breeds (n = 70); and 3) households without dairy cows (n = 66). Results showed that the predicted adoption rates for improved livestock feeding among households with improved dairy cows (stratum 2) were likely to be higher compared to households with only local cows (stratum 1). Both households with local cows and those with improved cows had increased income and food security. However, overall poverty reduction was only modest for households with local cows. Expected methane emissions intensity declined with adoption of improved livestock feeding strategies both in stratum 1 and stratum 2, and greater impacts were observed when households in stratum 2 received an additional improved cow breed. Providing a cow to households that were not keeping cows showed substantial economic gains. Additional research is, however, needed to understand why those farms currently do not have cows, which may determine if the predicted adoption rates are feasible. © 2016 The Authors","Climate-smart agriculture; Crop-livestock systems; Food security; Ruminant model; Tanzania; Trade-off analysis","adaptive management; agricultural technology; cattle; climate change; food security; greenhouse gas; investment; livestock farming; mixed farming; prioritization; ruminant; rural population; socioeconomic impact; trade-off; Sub-Saharan Africa; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006489310

For this reason, the US FDA has promulgated the Produce Rule, mandating the testing of irrigation water sources for many farms. The rule requires the collection and analysis of at least 20 water samples over two to four years to adequately evaluate the quality of water intended for produce irrigation. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of interannual weather variability on surface water microbial quality. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model to simulate E. coli concentrations in the Little Cove Creek; this is a perennial creek located in an agricultural watershed in south-eastern Pennsylvania. The model performance was evaluated using the US FDA regulatory microbial water quality metrics of geometric mean (GM) and the statistical threshold value (STV). Using the 90-year time series of weather observations, we simulated and randomly sampled the time series of E. coli concentrations. We found that weather conditions of a specific year may strongly affect the evaluation of microbial quality and that the long-term assessment of microbial water quality may be quite different from the evaluation based on short-term observations. The variations in microbial concentrations and water quality metrics were affected by location, wetness of the hydrological years, and seasonality, with 15.7–70.1% of samples exceeding the regulatory threshold.

Methods: Application of quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) of biogas wastewater was conducted in Hanam Province, Vietnam. A total of 451 representatives from households that use biogas were interviewed about their practices of handling biogas plant and reuse of biogas effluent for irrigation. In addition, 150 samples of biogas wastewater were analyzed for Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Giardia lamblia. Risk characterization was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation. Results: The annual diarrhea risk caused by exposure to biogas effluent through irrigation activities ranged from 17.4 to 21.1% (E. coli O157:H7), 1.0 to 2.3% (G. lamblia), and 0.2 to 0.5% (C. parvum), while those caused through unblocking drains connected to biogas effluent tanks were 22.0% (E. coli), 0.7% (G. lamblia), and 0.5% (C. parvum). Conclusions: Further measures are needed to reduce the risk by either improving the microbial quality of biogas effluent or by ensuring the use of personal protective measures when exposed to biogas wastewater. © 2016, Swiss School of Public Health (SSPH+).","Biogas effluent; Diarrhea; Exposure; Livestock waste; QMRA; Vietnam; Wastewater","biofuel; agricultural worker; analysis; animal; Cryptosporidium parvum; diarrhea; environmental exposure; Escherichia coli; Giardia intestinalis; human; irrigation (agriculture); isolation and purification; livestock; microbiology; parasitology; procedures; risk assessment; waste water; Agricultural Irrigation; Animals; Biofuels; Cryptosporidium parvum; Diarrhea; Environmental Exposure; Escherichia coli; Farmers; Giardia lamblia; Humans; Livestock; Risk Assessment; Waste Water; Water Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994756465

The present study develops a new model based on Mathematical Programming-based Multi-Agent System (MPMAS), a simulation software that allows assessing ex-ante the impact of alternative pesticide use reduction strategies, including combinations of pesticide taxes, the introduction of integrated pest management, a price premium for safe agricultural produce, and subsidies for biopesticides. The model is parameterized with farm and plot level data from northern of Thailand, where the adoption of high-value cash crops has been accompanied by a rapid increase in synthetic pesticide use. Simulation results suggest that a pesticide tax alone has little effect on synthetic pesticide use. A smart policy package – combining integrated pest management, a progressive pesticide tax based on toxicity and subsidies lowering the price of biopesticides – can reduce average use of hazardous pesticides by 34% over current levels without adverse effects on the average farm income. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Developing countries; Ex-ante assessment; Integrated pest management; Multi-agent systems; Pesticide policy","assessment method; biopesticide; developing world; ecological economics; integrated pest management; numerical model; pesticide; pesticide application; policy making; software; trade-environment relations; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994010691

They belong to the class of individual-based modelling approaches, which allow a bottom-up representation of the system being modelled, eliciting its macro-level evolution while modelling the micro-level behavior of its individuals. This paper deals with the application of an ABM to simulate future crop patterns in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg under a pre-defined scenario. The simulated scenario deals with the introduction of a “green consciousness” component in farmers' decisions, substituting a purely rational approach based only on profit maximization. The results of the ABM are used to perform a life cycle assessment of Luxembourg's agricultural system. The paper first describes the difficulties and the challenges connected with building an ABM for agriculture and then shows the results of the selected case study. The results show that, from a lifecycle perspective, a “greenness” criterion aimed only at reducing greenhouse gases emissions reveals patently a sub-optimal choice and causes burden shifts to other impact categories. Finally the ABM-based (bottom-up) approach is compared with a top-down approach applied in a previous study by the same authors to model the same system.

This time, the results suggest that removing subsidies on fossil fuels would create opportunities provided that such is done in tandem with complementary policies. In particular, we show that a mix of ‘agricultural productivity improvement’ and a ‘reduction in trade transaction costs’ (at 15% in each case) would provide benefits for fossil fuel subsidies removal in Ghana.

The catchment is a part of the Southern Agricultural Corridor of Tanzania where major agricultural intensification is expected to take place. Given the role of this catchment, it is important to investigate the effect of agricultural intensification, land-use/land-cover (LULC) change and climate variability on water balance in the catchment. Thus, the objective of the study was to simulate Usangu Catchment’s LULC of 2020 based on LULC of 2000, 2006 and 2013 using Markov Chain and Cellular Automata Analysis.Social, edaphic, climatic and landscape geomorphology factors governing the LULC change and distribution were used to prepare LULC suitability maps in geographical information system.The relative importance of LULC change factors was determined using the analytic hierarchy process and aggregated using weighted linear combination under multi-criteria evaluation approach. The model was validated using simulated and observed LULC 2013. The standard kappa coefficient (κ-standard) and overall agreements of the model were 0.6776 and 0.9125, respectively. The error due to quantity is 0.0243 while error due to allocation is 0.0667.

However, future climate conditions (FCCs) are expected to exacerbate water quality degradation in the CBW by increasing nitrate loads from agriculture. Accordingly, the question remains whether WCCs are sufficient to mitigate increased nutrient loads caused by FCCs. In this study, we assessed the impacts of FCCs on WCC nitrate reduction efficiency in the Coastal Plain of the CBW using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Three FCC scenarios (2085-2098) were prepared using general circulation models (GCMs), considering three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) greenhouse gas emission scenarios. We also developed six representative WCC implementation scenarios based on the most commonly used planting dates and species of WCCs in this region. Simulation results showed that WCC biomass increased by ~58% under FCC scenarios due to climate conditions conducive to WCC growth. Prior to implementing WCCs, annual nitrate loads increased by ~43% under FCC scenarios compared to the baseline scenario (2001-2014). When WCCs were planted, annual nitrate loads were substantially reduced by ~48%, and WCC nitrate reduction efficiency was ~5% higher under FCC scenarios relative to the baseline scenario. The increase in WCC nitrate reduction efficiency varied with FCC scenario and WCC planting method. As CO2 concentrations were higher and winters were warmer under FCC scenarios, WCCs had greater biomass and thus demonstrated higher nitrate reduction efficiency. In response to FCC scenarios, the performance of less effective WCC practices (i.e., barley, wheat, and late planting) under the baseline scenario indicated a ~14% higher increase in nitrate reduction efficiency compared to WCC practices with greater effectiveness under the baseline scenario (i.e., rye and early planting) due to warmer temperatures. The SWAT simulation results indicated that WCCs were effective in mitigating nitrate loads accelerated by FCCs, suggesting the role of WCCs in mitigating nitrate loads will likely be even more important under FCCs.","Future climate conditions (FCCs); SWAT; Water quality; Winter cover crops (WCCs)","Climate change; Climate models; Crops; Efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nitrates; Water quality; Future climate; General circulation model; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Soil and water assessment tool; Special report on emissions scenarios; SWAT; Water quality degradation; Winter cover crops; Barium compounds; agricultural runoff; baseline conditions; climate conditions; climate effect; coastal zone; cover crop; enrichment; environmental degradation; environmental impact assessment; future prospect; general circulation model; implementation process; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; mitigation; nitrate; scenario analysis; soil and water assessment tool; temperature effect; warming; water management; water quality; watershed; winter; Chesapeake Bay; Israeli Coastal Plain; United States; Hordeum; Secale cereale; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040031428

The SDA is a methodological tool that can be used to study and manage complex and dynamic systems characterized by feedback mechanisms, which can be relevantly influenced by the policy&decision-making process and its delays. The SDA may help to define, implement and evaluate decision makers choices from the output of systems to stimulations from the outside. Scientific literature provides important experiences in the field of these simulation models, both for the development of ecological agriculture and for the simulation of the impacts of policy scenarios in a certain region/area. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is a farming system, mainly for arable crops, which helps to achieve goals of sustainable and profitable agriculture. It is currently playing an ever-increasing role in the frame of EU agricultural policies in consideration of the positive impacts it can produce, in terms of sustainable use of natural resources as well as of Climate Change mitigation and adaptation. At farm level, moreover, CA represents a way to combine environmental and sustainability concerns with profitability and competitiveness aspects, in a variety of agroecological zones and farming conditions. Short-term solutions and immediate benefits always attract farmers more than long-term ones. Unfortunately, the full technical, environmental and economic advantages provided by the adoption of CA can be measured and appreciated by farmers only in the medium and long-term, when its principles (minimum soil disturbance, permanent soil cover crop rotation) are well established within the farming system. This evidence, together with other technical, social and cultural forces, relevantly affects the process of CA adoption at farm level as well as the effectiveness of agricultural policy efforts aiming at this result. The aim of this study is to validate a Systemic Dynamic Model (SDM) to be used in ex-ante evaluation to address the public action towards the effective achievement of the planned result of supporting the adoption of CA techniques in a certain region. It seeks answers to strategic questions related to the elements that could influence the effectiveness of the support payment schemes programmed into the sub-measure 10.1 of 2014-2020 Sicily Rural Development Programme (SRDP). The SDA considers relevant variables which affect the application and dissemination of CA techniques among potential beneficiaries whose number is estimated based on sub-measure access conditions and restrictions. For this purpose, the model structure is based on environmental, social and economic issues, e.g. physical and economic farm dimensions, provision of machinery hire, advisory services, reduction of production costs, etc. Results show that in a long term dynamic context the environmental support payment scheme provided by Measure 10 does not represent the only driving force in the system to guide farmers towards the expected shift from conventional to CA agriculture. What is needed is a deeper integration with other policies (innovation policies) and other interventions, e.g. schemes promoting precision farming, collective investments, advice, training and information Copyright © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Climate change; Crops; Decision making; Dynamics; Machinery; Profitability; Regional planning; Soils; Sustainable development; System theory; Agricultural policies; Climate change mitigation; Conservation agricultures; Decision making process; Ecological agricultures; Environmental supports; System dynamics approach; System dynamics model; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026399859

Using statistical data, simulation modeling, and a dynamic analysis framework, the authors assess the potential and distribution of regional agricultural biomass in Heilongjiang, China. The results indicate 32.48 × 106 t of agricultural biomass were available in 2003; this soared to 77.13 × 106 t in 2013. Gray correlation analysis demonstrated that precipitation, total population, mechanical power and agricultural planting structure largely influenced the availability of biomass resources. The support of corn oil storage plays an important role of agricultural planting structure. Statistical and Net Primary Production data were used to study the dynamic change in the availability of agricultural biomass. The growth rate of available biomass exceeded 2 t km−2 y−1 in most areas of the Sanjiang Plain, and ranged from − 1.5 to 2.0 t km−2 y−1 in the Songnen Plain. The establishment of a scientific resource management and scheduling platform is suggested to achieve the dynamic allocation and scheduling of agricultural biomass that will improve resource stability. The methods here can also be applied to other regions and provide baseline data for local authorities to further consider a strategy for bioenergy planning and development. © 2017","Agricultural biomass; Bioenergy; China; Heilongjiang Province","Agriculture; Digital storage; Public policy; Scheduling; Spatial variables measurement; Agricultural biomass; Bio-energy; China; Gray correlation analysis; Heilongjiang; Net primary production; Planning and development; Spatial temporal analysis; Biomass; alternative energy; bioenergy; biomass; correlation; energy policy; China; Heilongjiang; Songnen Plain; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022224092

A set of structural relations has been formulated to interlink growth of these sectors and role of investment. Variables in these structural relations were first looked into for stationarity of the series on the basis of Augmented Dicky-Fuller test; and structural relations have been estimated using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) to study the contribution of investment in Agriculture & Allied sector in the overall growth rate of economy. The study brings out structural relations interlinking growth in Agriculture & Allied, Industry, and Service sectors. Estimated results indicate strong influence of Agriculture & Allied sector on Industry and Service sectors. Besides, crowding -in effect of public investment on private investment in Agriculture & Allied sector was also established. Finally, alternate simulation scenarios have been examined that support to pursue policy of public sector investment in Agriculture & Allied sector. Effect of pursuing policy of augmenting public investment in Agriculture & Allied sector lead to increase in sectoral as well as aggregate growth rate in GDP at a feasible and manageable within limits of the overall government expenditure, thus it is rational -more so, in light of providing food security. © 2017 -IOS Press and the authors.

To this end, it is essential to develop tools, such as supporting information systems (SIS), for managing the environmental risks of veterinary pharmaceuticals on a territorial scale. In this context, we propose Sust-PHarm (SUSTainable use of veterinary Pharmaceuticals), a SIS useful to identify groundwater vulnerable areas to veterinary pharmaceuticals at both local and regional scale. As background, Sust-PHarm follows the schemes of SIS for pesticides. The latter are based on the integration of predictive models in GIS. The proposed approach goes a step forward by integrating also data on the typologies of livestock farm, their spatial distribution and manure management techniques. This information allows to identify the potential environmental loads of veterinary pharmaceuticals. In this paper, we discuss the innovative elements characterizing Sust-PHarm through a comparison with the SIS currently used for pesticides. The advantages of Sust-PHarm are discussed using Lombardia Region (Northern Italy) as a case study. Simulations were made on 12 veterinary pharmaceuticals characterized by different physical-chemical properties. Results are compared with the current guidelines for the evaluation of veterinary pharmaceuticals leaching highlighting some substantial differences when realistic data are utilized making our approach more accurate than guidelines one. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Decision support systems; Environmental fate; Groundwater; Spatial modelling; Veterinary medicinal products","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Fertilizers; Groundwater; Manures; Pesticides; Environmental fate; Environmental fate models; Environmental loads; Environmental risks; Physical chemical property; Spatial modelling; Veterinary medicinal products; Veterinary pharmaceuticals; Sustainable development; amoxicillin; chlortetracycline; drug; florfenicol; flumequine; ground water; ivermectin; lincomycin; oxytetracycline; pesticide; sulfadiazine; sulfadimethoxine; sulfadimidine; trimethoprim; tylosin; unclassified drug; veterinary medicinal product; veterinary drug; decision support system; drug; environmental fate; European Union; groundwater; livestock farming; manure; modeling; sustainability; waste management; Article; awareness; comparative study; computer simulation; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental awareness; environmental fate model; environmental impact; environmental risk; factual database; geographic and geological phenomena; geographic information system; groundwater vulnerable area; information system; Italy; manure management; nonbiological model; physical chemistry; predicted environmental concentration; priority journal; risk; soil analysis; supporting information system; waste management; chemistry; environmental monitoring; manure; risk management; theoretical model; Databases, Factual; Environmental Monitoring; Groundwater; Italy; Manure; Models, Theoretical; Risk Management; Veterinary Drugs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003989003

Thus, safe disposal of dead pigs is important to the protection of consumer health and the ecological environment by preventing marketing of slaughtered and processed dead pigs and improper dumping of dead pigs. In this study, a probability model was constructed for the disposal of dead pigs by pig farmers by selecting factors affecting disposal. To that end, we drew on the definition and meaning of behavior probability based on survey data collected from 654 pig farmers in Funing County, Jiangsu Province, China. Moreover, the role of influencing factors in pig farmers’ behavioral choices regarding the disposal of dead pigs was simulated by simulation experiment. The results indicated that years of farming had a positive impact on pig farmers’ choice of negative disposal of dead pigs. Moreover, there was not a simple linear relationship between scale of farming and pig farmers’ behavioral choices related to the disposal of dead pigs. The probability for farmers to choose the safe disposal of dead pigs increased with the improvement of their knowledge of government policies and relevant laws and regulations. Pig farmers’ behavioral choice about the disposal of dead pigs was also affected by government subsidy policies, regulation, and punishment. Government regulation and punishment were more effective than subsidy. The findings of our simulation experiment provide important decision-making support for the governance in preventing the marketing of dead pigs at the source. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Behavior probability model; Computer simulation experiment; Disposal of dead pigs; Expected return","agricultural worker; attitudinal survey; computer simulation; farmers attitude; mortality; numerical model; pig; preference behavior; probability; subsidy system; waste disposal; China; Jiangsu; Suidae; waste disposal; agricultural worker; agriculture; animal; cadaver; China; government regulation; human; legislation and jurisprudence; pig; questionnaire; waste disposal; Agriculture; Animals; Cadaver; China; Farmers; Government Regulation; Humans; Medical Waste Disposal; Surveys and Questionnaires; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992315976

Furthermore, LCA generally has often been criticized for being a decision maker tool which may not consider decision takers perceptions. They are lacking in spatial and temporal depth, and unable to assess sufficiently some environmental impact categories such as biodiversity, land use etc. and most economic and social impact categories, e.g. food security, water security, energy security. This study explored tools, methodologies and frameworks that can be deployed individually, as well as in combination with each other for bridging these methodological gaps in application to agro-bioenergy systems. Integrating agronomic options, e.g. alternative farm power, tillage, seed sowing options, fertilizer, pesticide, irrigation into the boundaries of LCAs for agro-bioenergy systems will not only provide an alternative agro-ecological perspective to previous LCAs, but will also lead to the derivation of indicators for assessment of some social and economic impact categories. Deploying life cycle thinking approaches such as energy return on energy invested-EROEI, human appropriation of net primary production-HANPP, net greenhouse gas or carbon balance-NCB, water footprint individually and in combination with each other will also lead to further derivation of indicators suitable for assessing relevant environmental, social and economic impact categories.

Especially in the Mediterranean region, irrigated agriculture is considered one of the most important drivers of hydro-morphological modifications in river systems. In this study we employ the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) methodology for the Pinios River and its tributaries, located in a Mediterranean catchment in central Greece, with the purpose to assess the natural flow regime under a simulated no-agriculture scenario and compare with the current situation. The work is based on the use of the SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) model for the simulation of long time series of daily stream flows, which were analyzed under the actual conditions (baseline), and the hypothetical scenario. The key characteristics of the flow regime projected under each model run were assessed through the implementation of the IHA methodology that utilizes a number of indicators to characterize the intra- and inter-annual variability in the hydrologic conditions. The results of this study revealed that without agricultural activities in the catchment, annual and monthly flows would increase, with significant alterations in the flow characteristics of the winter months, and much smaller in summer. However, the analysis showed that the frequency of droughts and low flow summer events would be smaller.

With rapid development of tools and technologies over the previous half century (e.g., computer simulation), a plethora of disciplines have developed methods to address individual components of these multifaceted, complex problems, oftentimes neglecting unintended consequences to other systems. A systems thinking approach is needed to (1) address these contemporary AGNR issues given their multi- and interdisciplinary aspects; (2) utilize a holistic perspective to accommodate all of the elements of the problem; and (3) include qualitative and quantitative techniques to incorporate ""soft"" and ""hard"" elements into the analyses. System dynamics (SD) methodology is uniquely suited to investigate AGNR given their inherently complex behaviors. In this paper, we review applications of SD to AGNR and discuss the potential contributions and roles of SD in addressing emergent problems of the 21st century. We identified numerous SD cases applied to water, soil, food systems, and smallholder issues. More importantly, several case studies are shown illustrating the tradeoffs between short-term and long-term strategies and the pitfalls of relying on quick fixes to AGNR problems (known as ""fixes that backfire"" and ""shifting the burden"", well-known, commonly occurring, systemic structures-or archetypes-observed across numerous management situations [Senge, P.M. The Fifth Discipline, 1st ed.; Doubleday: New York, NY, USA, 1990.]). We conclude that common attempts to alleviate AGNR problems, across continents and regardless of the type of resources involved, have suffered from reliance on short-term management strategies. To effectively address AGNR problems, longer-term thinking and strategies aimed at fundamental solutions will be needed to better identify and minimize the often delayed, and unintended, consequences arising from feedback between management interventions and AGNR systems. © 2016 by the authors.","Agriculture; Complex systems; Computer simulation; Interdisciplinary; Management; Natural resources; System dynamics; Systems analysis; Unintended consequences",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018219576

Substantial investment in conservation actions has had insufficient impact, due in part to a limited basis for understanding the likely environmental outcomes of those investments. This article introduces a special section focusing on promoting investment that produces environmental outcomes as opposed to investing in conservation actions with unknown effects. The special section contains articles in three main categories: 1) studies based on fine-grain SWAT and other simulation modeling that can guide the type, amount, and location of conservation investments to increase their environmental impact; 2) edge-of-field measurement studies that provide updated knowledge to assist in further refining models to increase their predictive power; and 3) articles presenting innovative approaches to incentivizing outcome-oriented conservation investment. Implementation approaches discussed include certifying private crop nutrient advisors as recommending only appropriate timing, amount, and placement of nutrients; working within the existing public drain management system to incentivize conservation; and others. The special section shows that advances in SWAT modeling provide a powerful basis for targeting conservation investments to protect water quality in the Great Lakes Basin, while also demonstrating opportunities to further refine the models. It illustrates both the opportunity and the need to engage in more innovative institutional design of agricultural management programs that go beyond the traditional government programs and do more to reward outcomes and not just actions. © 2016 International Association for Great Lakes Research.","Harmful algal bloom; Non-point source pollution; Pay for performance; Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT); Watershed modeling","Agricultural runoff; Agriculture; Economics; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Investments; Land use; Nutrients; Sustainable development; Water pollution; Water quality; Harmful algal blooms; Non-point source pollution; Pay for performance; Soil and water assessment tool; Watershed modeling; Lakes; agricultural land; agricultural runoff; algal bloom; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; hydrological modeling; incentive; land use; nonpoint source pollution; soil and water assessment tool; sustainable development; water quality; watershed; Great Lakes Basin; algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006827073

Knowing the source as well as the characteristics of pollutants is the premise for their control and treatment. But now, sampling for understanding pollutants in soil is difficult and costly resulting in limited number of soil samples from the As contaminated land. For the problem that it is hard to accurately and efficiently map the spatial distribution of soil As concentration based on limited soil samples. In this study, we collected a total of 104 top soil samples (0~20cm) from agricultural land, in a southeast of Guangdong province. A combined approach of spatial analysis and multiple regression modeling was developed to recognize the statistical characteristic of As concentration in sampling soil, and to reveal their formation causes of spatial variation and associated spatial patterns in vegetable field, paddy and orchard. Results showed that in general, As concentration of soil samples was largely not exceeding the national standard in the agricultural land of the studied area. However, As concentration of few soil samples was still exceeding the National Environment Quality Standard for soil (GB15618-1995), with the maximum value was 137.80 mg/kg. Among three different types of agricultural lands, the soil As concentration in vegetable field was the highest, followed by the paddy and orchard, with mean values of 11.04, 9.89 and 2.54 mg/kg, respectively. The sources of soil As contamination were variable in different agricultural land. In vegetable field, soil As concentration was closely interrelated with shortest distances between samples and chimneys and rivers, and the slope of sample sites. Significance value of the soil As concentration simulation model in vegetable field was 0.010 (P<0.05). In paddy, the dominant factor of soil As concentration was the shortest distances between samples and rivers. Significance value of the soil As concentration simulation model in paddy was 0.044 (P<0.05). However, the multiple linear regression models of soil As concentration simulation in orchard were not significant (P>0.05) in this study. The results suggested that the soil As contamination in vegetable field mainly was affected by the river sewage irrigation and surface runoff of polluted gas from chimneys. The area with high soil As concentration was distributed in the northern part, and lower in other regions. In paddy, the soil As contamination was significantly only affected by the sewage irrigation, with higher As contamination in the north and south, and lower in other regions. But no obvious source of soil As pollution was found in orchard soil. This study would provide a scientific method for accurately mapping the spatial distribution of heavy metal pollution in agricultural land and consequently guide the policy making of precise prevention and control based on sparse sampling data. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

A systematic review was used to show the potential of Value Stream Mapping (VSM) not only to identify and reduce food losses and wastes, but also as a way to establish links with nutrient retention in supply chains. The review compiled literature from 24 studies that applied VSM in the agri-food industry. Primary production, processing, storage, food service and/or consumption were identified as susceptible hotspots for losses and wastes. Results further revealed discarding and nutrient loss, most especially at the processing level, as the main forms of loss/waste in food, which were adapted to four out of seven lean manufacturing wastes (i.e. defect, unnecessary inventory, overproduction and inappropriate processing). This paper presents the state of the art of applying lean manufacturing practices in the agri-food industry by identifying lead time as the most applicable performance indicator. VSM was also found to be compatible with other lean tools such as Just-In-Time and 5S which are continuous improvement strategies, as well as simulation modelling that enhances adoption. In order to ensure successful application of lean practices aimed at minimizing food or nutrient losses and wastes, multi-stakeholder collaboration along the entire food supply chain is indispensable. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Food loss; Food supply chain; Food waste; Lean manufacturing; Nutrient loss; Value Stream Mapping","Agile manufacturing systems; Chemical contamination; Food supply; Lean production; Manufacture; Mapping; Nutrients; Supply chains; Wastes; Continuous improvements; Food loss; Food waste; Manufacturing practices; Manufacturing wastes; Nutrient loss; Performance indicators; Value stream mapping; Food storage; food supply; manufacturing; mapping; nutrient loss; solid waste; waste management; waste technology; case study; catering service; food; food chain; food industry; food intake; food loss; food processing; food storage; food waste; limit of quantitation; priority journal; prospective study; Review; simulation; systematic review; value stream mapping; waste management; agriculture; catering service; cost; economics; food handling; meta analysis; procedures; waste management; Agriculture; Costs and Cost Analysis; Food Handling; Food Supply; Waste Management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996554624

A full accounting and understanding of the GHG emissions associated with specific activities, materials, and energy used in organic operations are needed to support decision-making for GHG mitigation. A small-scale organic vegetable farm in Washington State, USA, was used as a case study to determine the carbon footprint (CF) and GHG hotspots. A partial life cycle assessment was conducted to identify primary and secondary GHG fluxes associated with activities and materials used in production of potatoes, cauliflower, dry bush beans, winter squash, summer squash, chard, peppers, and onions grown in a crop rotation. The CF associated with each crop ranged from a low of 1.68 t CO2-eq ha− 1 yr− 1 for chard to a high of 2.67 t CO2-eq ha− 1 yr− 1 for cauliflower. Cauliflower had the highest CF per ha followed by potatoes and pepper. Across the farm as a whole, the major CF hotspots were fuel use for both on-farm and off-farm operations (38%), fertilization (18%), soil emission (12%), and irrigation (11%). Simulation of a switch to biodiesel instead of petroleum gasoline and diesel resulted in a 32% reduction in the total farm CF. By identifying the CF hotspots of a whole farm and individual crops, particular inputs and activities can be targeted for modification in order to effectively reduce the farm's CF. © 2016","Carbon footprint; GHG emissions; Organic farming; Vegetable production","biofuel; carbon footprint; crop production; crop yield; decision making; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; organic farming; soil emission; vegetable; United States; Washington [United States]; Beta vulgaris cicla; Brassica oleracea var. botrytis; Capsicum; Cucurbita maxima; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986880367

Crop production needs not only to be increased, but also remain stable over the years, in order to limit the vulnerability of producers and consumers to inter-annual weather variability, especially in areas of the world where the food consumed is mainly produced locally (e.g. Sub Saharan Africa (SSA)). For subsistence agriculture, stable yields form a crucial contribution to food security. At a regional to global scale dynamical crop models can be used to study the impact of future changes in climate on food production. However, simulations of future crop production, for instance in response to climate change, often do not take into account either changes in the sown areas of crops or yield interannual variability. Here, we explore the response of simulated crop production to assumptions of crop selection, also taking into account interannual variability in yields and considering the response of agricultural productivity to climate change. We apply the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-GUESS, which is designed to simulate yield over large regions under a changing environment. Model output provides the basis for selecting the relative fractions of sown areas of a range of crops, either by selecting the highest yielding crop, or by using an optimization approach in which crop production is maximized while the standard deviation in crop production is kept at below current levels. Maximizing simulated crop production for current climate while keeping interannual variability in crop production constant at today's level generates rather similar simulated geographical distributions of crops compared to observations. Even so, the optimization results suggest that it is possible to increase crop production regionally by adjusting crop selection, both for current and future climate, assuming the same cropland cover as today. For future climates modelled production increase is > 25% in more than 15% of the grid cells.

Here we explore how payments for carbon sequestration and phosphorus retention affect the profitability and economic competitiveness of perennial herbaceous biomass. We consider the case of converting marginal land currently in corn and soy production in southern Minnesota, United States, to native diverse prairie grown as a biofuel feedstock. We estimate the resulting changes in soil carbon storage and water quality, and the economic value of both. To test the robustness of our results, we perform Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate variability and uncertainty in our model parameters. Our analyses show that prairie biomass production on marginal lands is 22% likely to be profitable when ecosystem service compensation is included, but only 5% when it is not. This suggests that the two ecosystem services modeled here may alone be insufficient to make prairie biomass production reliably profitable. Furthermore, by using ranges of model parameters rather than point estimates, this study shows that the profitability gap between conventional row crops and prairie is too large to be closed with the two services modeled here across a range of recent economic conditions. © 2016 The Authors","Agriculture; Bioenergy; Cellulosic; Ecosystem service; Monte Carlo; Prairie",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982791314

We pioneered a new feedstock supply model in which the formal official organization of villagers' committees is introduced. Different from the previous feedstock supply patterns, the immaterial utility of relative stakeholders and the impact of villagers' committees on farmers' behavior are considered in this paper. To compare this pattern's performance with that of the conventional ones, this paper developed a multi-agent model specifically for China's situation. We applied the model to simulate the operation of a biomass supply chain. The results show that the proposed feedstock supply pattern can significantly increase the profits of biomass plants, biomass supply amounts, and farmers' participation, and in contrast with the broker pattern, it can lower feedstock prices through disintermediation. Sensitivity analyses show that preferential feed-in tariffs are still necessary for biomass power and that the new pattern can ease the government's subsidy burdens. Additionally, farmers' opportunity costs for supplying biomass, their perceptions of immaterial utility and the cooperative's financial resource schemes of the public welfare fund all have differing impacts on the achievement of the new pattern. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass generation; Feedstock supply chain; Multi-agent simulation","Agriculture; Feedstocks; Multi agent systems; Rural areas; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Biomass generation; Biomass power generations; Biomass supply chain; Feedstock supply; Financial resources; Multi agent simulation; Multi-Agent Model; Opportunity costs; Biomass; biomass power; computer simulation; governance approach; numerical model; performance assessment; planning method; power generation; power plant; profitability; stakeholder; tariff structure; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979518599

Only a small fraction of those efforts have focused on phytoremediation techniques. Each of six different aquatic macrophytes were planted, in monoculture, in three replicate mesocosms (1.2 m × 0.15 m × 0.65 m). Three additional unvegetated mesocosms served as controls for a total number of 21 mesocosms. Over two years, mesocosms were amended once each summer with sodium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, and potassium phosphate dibasic to represent nitrogen and phosphorus in agricultural runoff. System retention was calculated using a simple aqueous mass balance approach. Ammonium retention in both years differed greatly, as Panicum hemitomon and Echinodorus cordifolius retentions were significantly greater than controls in the first year, while only Myriophyllum aquaticum and Typha latifolia were significantly greater than controls in the second year. Greater soluble reactive phosphorus retention was observed in T. latifolia compared to controls in both years. Several other significant differences were observed in either the first or second year, but not both years. In the first year's exposure, P. hemitomon was significantly more efficient than the control, Saururus cernuus, and T. latifolia for overall percent nitrate decrease. Results of this novel study highlight inherent variability within and among species for nutrient specific uptake and the temporal variations of species for nutrient retention. By examining this natural variability, scientists may design phytoremediation systems with greater impact on improving agricultural runoff water quality. © 2016","Mesocosm; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Phytoremediation; Wetland","Agriculture; Aquatic ecosystems; Bioremediation; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Potassium compounds; Sodium nitrate; Sulfur compounds; Water quality; Wetlands; Inherent variability; Management practices; Mesocosms; Mississippi River Basin; Myriophyllum aquaticum; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Phytoremediation; Soluble reactive phosphorus; Agricultural runoff; ammonium sulfate; dipotassium hydrogen phosphate; nitrogen; phosphorus; sodium nitrate; ammonium derivative; nitric acid derivative; pollutant; sodium nitrate; agricultural runoff; ammonium; aquatic plant; macrophyte; mass balance; mesocosm; monoculture; nitrate; nitrogen; nutrient uptake; phosphate; phosphorus; phytoremediation; river basin; wetland; aquatic vegetation; Article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; Echinodorus cordifolius; macrophyte; mesocosm; monoculture; Myriophyllum aquaticum; nonhuman; Panicum; Panicum hemitomon; phytoremediation; runoff; Saururus cernuus; simulation; summer; Thalia dealbata; Typha latifolia; vegetation; water quality; agriculture; Alismataceae; bioremediation; chemistry; ecosystem; metabolism; microbiology; Mississippi; plant; pollutant; river; Typhaceae; Mississippi River; United States; Echinodorus cordifolius; Myriophyllum aquaticum; Panicum hemitomon; Saururus cernuus; Typha latifolia; Agriculture; Alismataceae; Ammonium Compounds; Biodegradation, Environmental; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollutants; Mississippi; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Panicum; Phosphorus; Plants; Rivers; Typhaceae; Water Microbiology; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976631603

Associated economic gains and losses differ not only by region but also between producers and consumers and are affected by market dynamics. On the basis of an impact modeling chain, starting with 19 different climate projections that drive plant biophysical process simulations and ending with agro-economic decisions, this analysis focuses on distributional effects of high-end climate change impacts across geographic regions and across economic agents. By estimating the changes in surpluses of consumers and producers, we find that climate change can have detrimental impacts on global agricultural welfare, especially after 2050, because losses in consumer surplus generally outweigh gains in producer surplus. Damage in agriculture may reach the annual loss of 0.3% of future total gross domestic product at the end of the century globally, assuming further opening of trade in agricultural products, which typically leads to interregional production shifts to higher latitudes. Those estimated global losses could increase substantially if international trade is more restricted. If beneficial effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide fertilization can be realized in agricultural production, much of the damage could be avoided. Although trade policy reforms toward further liberalization help alleviate climate change impacts, additional compensation mechanisms for associated environmental and development concerns have to be considered. 2016 © The Authors.",,"Agricultural products; Agriculture; Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Economic and social effects; International trade; Productivity; Agricultural productions; Agricultural productivity; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Beneficial effects; Biophysical process; Climate change impact; Compensation mechanism; Gross domestic products; Climate change; carbon dioxide; agriculture; catering service; climate change; commercial phenomena; computer simulation; crop; economics; environment; human; metabolism; theoretical model; Agriculture; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Commerce; Computer Simulation; Crops, Agricultural; Environment; Food Supply; Humans; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020240137

However, few tools exist to evaluate whether potential transmission pathways in a population are adequately represented by an observed contact network. Here, we describe a novel permutation-based approach, the network k-test, to determine whether the pattern of cases within the observed contact network are likely to have resulted from transmission processes in the network, indicating that the network represents potential transmission pathways between nodes. Using simulated data of pathogen spread, we compare the power of this approach to other commonly used analytical methods. We test the robustness of this technique across common sampling constraints, including undetected cases, unobserved individuals and missing interaction data. We also demonstrate the application of this technique in two case studies of livestock and wildlife networks. We show that the power of the k-test to correctly identify the epidemiologic relevance of contact networks is substantially greater than other methods, even when 50% of contact or case data are missing. We further demonstrate that the impact of missing data on network analysis depends on the structure of the network and the type of missing data. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The model was calibrated using 6 years of data. The calibrated model was then used to determine the significance of the following factors on low DO: excavation of the river to allow navigation of large vessels, non-point source pollution from the agricultural watershed, effluent from a wastewater treatment plant, and non-point source pollution from an urban area. An alternative metric for low DO, excess net oxygen demand (ENOD), was applied to better characterize DO impairment. Model results indicate that the dredged ship channel had the most significant effect on DO (62 % fewer predicted hourly DO violations), followed by mass load inputs from the watershed (52 % fewer predicted hourly DO violations). Model results suggest that elimination of any one factor will not completely resolve DO impairment and that continued use of supplemental aeration is warranted. Calculation of ENOD proved more informative than the sole use of DO. Application of the simple model allowed for interpretation of the extensive data collected. The current monitoring program could be enhanced by additional monitoring stations that would provide better volumetric estimates of low DO. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","California; Dissolved oxygen; Estuary; Models; San Joaquin River; TMDL; Water quality","Dissolution; Dissolved oxygen; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Estuaries; Marine pollution; Models; Oxygen; Pollution; Rivers; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Water quality; Watersheds; Agricultural watersheds; California; High frequency data; Low dissolved oxygen; Non-point source pollution; San Joaquin River; TMDL; Wastewater treatment plants; River pollution; dissolved oxygen; oxygen; dissolved oxygen; dredging; estuary; pollution monitoring; river water; water quality; Article; data analysis; environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; estuary; excess net oxygen demand; high frequency data; link node model; mathematical analysis; model; oxygen consumption; pollution; simulation; United States; volumetry; water quality; watershed; agriculture; biochemical oxygen demand; California; estuary; procedures; river; sewage; theoretical model; California; San Joaquin River; United States; Agriculture; Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis; California; Environmental Monitoring; Estuaries; Models, Theoretical; Oxygen; Rivers; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978115100

This limitation is addressed by this article, which demonstrates the use of object representations in SSD. The objects are parcels of land that are attributed to grassland farms. The model simulates structural change in agriculture, i.e., change in the size of farms. The aim of the model is to reveal relations between structural change, farmland fragmentation and variable farmland quality. Results show that fragmented farms tend to become consolidated by structural change, whereas consolidated initial conditions result in a significant increase of fragmentation. Consolidation is reinforced by a dynamic land market and high transportation costs.

A cost-benefit analysis integrating market and non-market costs and benefits was undertaken in this study to assess the economic feasibility of a river rehabilitation project in a water scarce region, the Yarqon River Rehabilitation project (Israel). In this case, the costs included both the capital costs of implementing rehabilitation measures (including maintenance costs) and the opportunity costs of water allocation (foregone benefits to farmers from water provisioning for agriculture). The benefits of rehabilitation included the net marginal benefits of the cultural ecosystem services at local scale (estimated with a hedonic pricing method), and at regional scale (estimated with a value function transfer), in addition to the habitat service gene-pool protection (estimated with a replacement cost method). Bearing in mind the uncertainties surrounding water resource management decisions, especially in water scarce areas, a sensitivity and risk analysis was conducted using an analysis that included both Monte Carlo simulations and the standardized regression coefficients method. The rehabilitation of the Yarqon River provided positive net present values (approximately $139 million in 30-year period). This was thanks to the provision of cultural ecosystem services and despite the high rehabilitation costs, and that the massive water reallocation involved high foregone benefits to farmers. Therefore, these results highlight that river rehabilitation in water scarce regions can be economically viable due to the social amenity demand for urban rivers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Cost-benefit analysis; Ecosystem services; River rehabilitation; Sensitivity and risk analysis; Water scarcity","Article; cost benefit analysis; economic development; environmental economics; environmental planning; feasibility study; gene pool; human; irrigation (agriculture); Israel; Monte Carlo method; priority journal; resource allocation; risk assessment; river; river ecosystem; river rehabilitation; urban area; waste water management; water management; water quality; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963594851

This work investigates the potential exposure of a farmer cultivating a field nearby the largest former asbestos mine of Western Europe (Balangero, Italy). The concentration of waterborne asbestos in the stream used to water the field was measured (ca. 2 × 105 fibers per liter, ff/L) and the cultivated ultramafic topsoil characterized, evidencing a remarkable occurrence of chrysotile. The worker's personal exposure and the environmental fiber dispersion during a simulated agricultural activity (tillage) were quantified in two independent trials. During the trials, the worker was exposed to average concentrations of 16 and 26 ff/L, with a peak of 40 ff/L. These data inform about the possible exposure of an agricultural worker to asbestos concentration higher than the accepted threshold of 2 ff/L.

The aim of this study is to investigate the response of groundwater nitrate concentration in a public supply well to land-use change, discussing the effect of land-use change in tackling agricultural nitrate pollution in the aquifer. Six land-use scenarios were examined in predictive simulations of groundwater nitrate concentration. Groundwater flow modelling (MODFLOW) and mass transport modelling (MT3DMS), incorporating results from an export coefficient model, were used to predict groundwater nitrate concentration in the public supply well by 2025. Results from the quantitative comparison of scenarios revealed that the greatest decrease in nitrate concentration (35%) by 2025 in the public supply well was associated with the entire target zone being covered with forest, whereas a decrease dependent on the application of best agricultural practice achieved no more than a 20% reduction. It is concluded that the modelling framework constructed in this study is a useful tool for assessment of the impact of changes in land use and management on groundwater nitrate concentration in public supply wells. © 2016 The Author(s).",,"Agriculture; Aquifers; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Nitrates; Pollution control; Agricultural activities; Agricultural practices; Export coefficient models; Groundwater flow modelling; Land use and managements; Nitrate concentration; Predictive simulations; Quantitative comparison; Land use; aquifer; concentration (composition); flow modeling; groundwater flow; land use change; mass transport; nitrate; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973343126

This framework was applied to the Gharbia drain in the Nile Delta, Egypt, in summer and winter 2012. First, the water quantity and quality of the drain was simulated using the QUAL2Kw model. Second, uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation were performed to assess QUAL2Kw's performance and to identify the most critical variables for determination of water quality, respectively. Finally, a genetic algorithm was applied to maximize the total reuse quantity from seven reuse locations with the condition not to violate the standards for using mixed water in irrigation. The water quality simulations showed that organic matter concentrations are critical management variables in the Gharbia drain. The uncertainty analysis showed the reliability of QUAL2Kw to simulate water quality and quantity along the drain. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis showed that the 5-day biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, total nitrogen and total phosphorous are highly sensitive to point source flow and quality. Additionally, the optimization results revealed that the reuse quantities of ADW can reach 36.3% and 40.4% of the available ADW in the drain during summer and winter, respectively. These quantities meet 30.8% and 29.1% of the drainage basin requirements for fresh irrigation water in the respective seasons. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Agricultural drainage water; Optimization; QUAL2Kw; Reuse; Sensitivity; Uncertainty","nitrogen; organic matter; fresh water; agricultural land; concentration (composition); drainage basin; drainage water; genetic algorithm; hydrological modeling; irrigation system; optimization; organic matter; recycling; sensitivity analysis; simulation; uncertainty analysis; water management; water quality; Article; biochemical oxygen demand; chemical oxygen demand; Egypt; flow rate; genetic algorithm; irrigation (agriculture); Monte Carlo method; pH; sensitivity analysis; simulation; summer; suspended particulate matter; temperature; waste water recycling; water quality; winter; agriculture; algorithm; irrigation (agriculture); procedures; reproducibility; season; standards; theoretical model; Egypt; Nile Delta; Agricultural Irrigation; Agriculture; Algorithms; Biological Oxygen Demand Analysis; Egypt; Fresh Water; Models, Theoretical; Monte Carlo Method; Reproducibility of Results; Seasons; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958978233

These forecasts, when public, influence crop prices and can be used to estimate end-of-season stocks. Thus, the skills and limitations of such products are important because they inform trade policies. In Europe, yield forecasts and agroclimatic indicators are made available to stakeholders several times during the growing season through the Monitoring of Agriculture with Remote Sensing (MARS). The MARS monthly bulletin relies on an in-depth analysis of past climate, short-term weather forecasts and crop growth simulations. In this paper, we focus on the occurrence of abnormally low yields and evaluate how accurately agro-climatic indicators and model outputs anticipate their occurrences for two crop species in two European countries of contrasted agroclimatic conditions. Importantly, the indicators considered here encompass a large range of complexity levels and several are used in the MARS Bulletin. Each indicator is independently used to predict the onset occurrence of an abnormal yield loss (henceforth named extreme) in France and in Spain for both winter wheat and non-irrigated grain maize for a period covering the 1976-2013 growing seasons. Indicators are ranked based on a score quantifying their ability to accurately separate extreme from non-extreme yield loss events. We provide and in-depth analysis of the robustness of our ranking to alternative definitions of extreme yield loss. No single indicator performs systematically well (e.g., whatever the country or crop species) but several show acceptable scores (e.g., averaged temperatures, vapor pressure deficit, precipitation, potential yield). We find no obvious relationship between the level of complexity of indicators and their accuracy. Single climate variables such as temperature or precipitation often perform as well as a crop model integrating temperatures and precipitation effects on crop growth. Namely, monthly averaged maximum temperatures and precipitation rank highest for both crop species in France. Drought indices perform well in Spain for wheat and for maize. We argue that our transparent framework can be useful to evaluate and improve crop-monitoring systems worldwide. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Climate indicators; Early-warning system; France; Spain; Yield residual","agrometeorology; climate conditions; crop residue; early warning system; environmental indicator; environmental monitoring; forecasting method; maize; trade policy; wheat; yield response; France; Spain; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956734029

Second generation bioenergy feedstocks offer a possible solution to this problem. They have the potential to reduce land-use conflicts between food and bioenergy production as they can be grown on low quality land not suitable for food production. However, a comprehensive impact assessment that considers multiple ecosystem services (ESS) and biodiversity is needed to identify the environmentally best feedstock option, as trade-offs are inherent. In this study, we simulate the spatial distribution of short rotation coppices (SRCs) in the landscape of the Mulde watershed in Central Germany by modeling profit-maximizing farmers under different economic and policy-driven scenarios using a spatially explicit economic simulation model. This allows to derive general insights and a mechanistic understanding of regional-scale impacts on multiple ESS in the absence of large-scale implementation. The modeled distribution of SRCs, required to meet the regional demand of combined heat and power (CHP) plants for solid biomass, had little or no effect on the provided ESS. In the policy-driven scenario, placing SRCs on low or high quality soils to provide ecological focus areas, as required within the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU, had little effect on ESS. Only a substantial increase in the SRC production area, beyond the regional demand of CHP plants, had a relevant effect, namely a negative impact on food production as well as a positive impact on biodiversity and regulating ESS. Beneficial impacts occurred for single ESS. However, the number of sites with balanced ESS supply hardly increased due to larger shares of SRCs in the landscape. Regression analyses showed that the occurrence of sites with balanced ESS supply was more strongly driven by biophysical factors than by the SRC share in the landscape. This indicates that SRCs negligibly affect trade-offs between individual ESS. Coupling spatially explicit economic simulation models with environmental and ESS assessment models can contribute to a comprehensive impact assessment of bioenergy feedstocks that have not yet been planted. © 2016 Schulze et al.

The Aquatic Conservation Strategy (ACS) of the Northwest Forest Plan guides management of riparian and aquatic ecosystems on federal lands in western Oregon, western Washington, and northern California. We applied new scientific findings and tools to evaluate two potential options, A and B, for refining interim riparian reserves to meet ACS goals and likely challenges of climate change while supporting other management goals, including timber production. Interim riparian reserves are retained in late-successional reserves and other special land designations in the options. In lands designated as matrix, the area for aquatic conservation extends upslope one site-potential tree-height along all streams, divided into an inner zone devoted solely to achieving ACS goals and an outer zone managed to achieve ACS and other goals. Option A uses a fixed-width approach and option B a context-dependent approach, with partitioning of zones based on the ecological sensitivity of stream reaches. Based on simulations of the area of interim riparian reserves in six watersheds in western Oregon with lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM): (1) about 76 percent under option A and 72 percent under option B remain solely devoted to ACS goals; (2) 15 percent under option A and 19 percent under option B should be able to meet ACS goals and also contribute toward matrix goals such as timber production; and (3) 9 percent would be returned to matrix. A large percentage of streams with high ecological sensitivity occurred on nonfederal lands, a circumstance that merits further analysis in the context of landscape-scale considerations for biodiversity and recovery of species listed under the Endangered Species Act. Information needs remain with regard to the application and effectiveness of these options, and an adaptive management context is critical for continued improvement. © 2016, USDA Forest Service-General Technical Report PNW-GTR.

Crop simulations at large scales (regional, national, continental) frequently use input data of low resolution. Therefore, climate and soil data are often generated via averaging and sampling by area majority. This may bias simulated yields at large scales, varying largely across models. Thus, we evaluated the error associated with spatially aggregated soil and climate data for 14 crop models. Yields of winter wheat and silage maize were simulated under water-limited production conditions.We calculated this error from crop yields simulated at spatial resolutions from 1 to 100 km for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Most models showed yields biased by <15% when aggregating only soil data. The relative mean absolute error (rMAE) of most models using aggregated soil data was in the range or larger than the inter-annual or intermodel variability in yields. This error increased further when both climate and soil data were aggregated. Distinct error patterns indicate that the rMAE may be estimated from few soil variables. Illustrating the range of these aggregation effects across models, this study is a first step towards an ex-ante assessment of aggregation errors in large-scale simulations. © 2016 Hoffmann et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"air temperature; Article; biomass; climate change; crop; Germany; harvest; maize; nonhuman; plant growth; silage; simulation; soil; soil depth; wheat; winter; agriculture; chemistry; computer simulation; crop; factual database; growth, development and aging; Oryza; procedures; soil; soil; water; Agriculture; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Crops, Agricultural; Databases, Factual; Oryza; Soil; Triticum; Water; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963759428

Currently, they are a tremendous burden because of the high losses they inflict on crops and livestock. Smallholder farmers in developing countries of Africa are likely to suffer more under these changes than farmers in the developed world because more severe climatic changes are projected in these areas. African countries further have a lower ability to cope with impacts of climate change through the lack of suitable adapted management strategies and financial constraints. In this study we are predicting current and future habitat suitability under changing climatic conditions for Tuta absoluta, Ceratitis cosyra, and Bactrocera invadens, three important insect pests that are common across some parts of Africa and responsible for immense agricultural losses. We use presence records from different sources and bioclimatic variables to predict their habitat suitability using the maximum entropy modelling approach.We find that habitat suitability for B. invadens, C. cosyra and T. absoluta is partially increasing across the continent, especially in those areas already overlapping with or close to most suitable sites under current climate conditions. Assuming a habitat suitability at three different threshold levels we assessed where each species is likely to be present under future climatic conditions and if this is likely to have an impact on productive agricultural areas. Our results can be used by African policy makers, extensionists and farmers for agricultural adaptation measures to cope with the impacts of climate change. © 2016 Biber-Freudenberger et al.

Based on the estimates of soil loss in 140,297km2 pasturelands of Goiás State and the Federal District, the effects of land use and management and conservation practices on soil erosion by water were evaluated. Soil loss was estimated with the empirical revised universal soil loss equation model under four scenarios of land use and management of pastures and the implementation of terraces. The effects of converting hilly areas into permanently preserved areas were also evaluated. Well-managed pastures planted in terraces and highly sloped areas with native vegetation featured a reduction of 709% in the rate of soil erosion by water in comparison with poorly managed pastures without soil conservation practices. The environmental consequences of pasture degradation become particularly important when they are associated with land use in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes because farmers in these regions are forced to open new natural areas. In addition, the high indices of bare soil in degraded pastures contribute significantly to sediment deposition in rivers and dams. The modeling of soil loss is demonstrated to be an important tool for land use planning and supporting public policies focused on the sustainable use of natural resources. The results of these simulations demonstrate the importance of actions to recover degraded pastures, such as the Federal Government's program known as ABC (Low Carbon Agriculture). © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Brazilian savanna; Geographic information system; Remote sensing; RUSLE; Soil loss; USLE","Agriculture; Carbon; Erosion; Geographic information systems; Land use; Remote sensing; Sediment transport; Soils; Water conservation; Brazilian savanna; Environmental consequences; Land use and managements; Low carbon agricultures; Revised universal soil loss equations; RUSLE; Soil loss; USLE; Soil conservation; GIS; government; loess; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; soil conservation; soil erosion; Brazil; Goias",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939234927

However, rigorous formal study is made difficult by the high level of mobility of pastoralists as well as by the sizable spatio-temporal variability of their environment. This article presents a new computational approach for studying mobile pastoralism that overcomes these issues. Combining multi-temporal satellite images and agent-based modeling allows a comprehensive examination of pastoral resource access over a realistic dryland landscape with unpredictable ecological dynamics. The article demonstrates the analytical potential of this approach through its application to mobile pastoralism in northeast Nigeria. Employing more than 100 satellite images of the area, extensive simulations are conducted under a wide array of circumstances, including different land-use constraints. The simulation results reveal complex dependencies of pastoral resource access on these circumstances along with persistent patterns of seasonal land use observed at the macro level. © 2016 Takuto Sakamoto.

Methods Based on data from Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study, we used comparative risk assessment to estimate the burden of 11 dietary and 4 metabolic risk factors on mortality due to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes in Brazil in 2010. Information on national diets and metabolic risks were obtained from the Brazilian Household Budget Survey, the Food and Agriculture Organization database, and large observational studies including Brazilian adults. Relative risks for each risk factor were obtained from meta-analyses of randomized trials or prospective cohort studies; and disease-specific mortality from the GBD 2010 database. We quantified uncertainty using probabilistic simulation analyses, incorporating uncertainty in dietary and metabolic data and relative risks by age and sex. Robustness of findings was evaluated by sensitivity to varying feasible optimal levels of each risk factor. Results In 2010, high systolic blood pressure (SBP) and suboptimal diet were the largest contributors to cardiometabolic deaths in Brazil, responsible for 214,263 deaths (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 195,073 to 233,936) and 202,949 deaths (95% UI: 194,322 to 211,747), respectively. Among individual dietary factors, low intakes of fruits and whole grains and high intakes of sodium were the largest contributors to cardiometabolic deaths. For premature cardiometabolic deaths (before age 70 years, representing 40% of cardiometabolic deaths), the leading risk factors were suboptimal diet (104,169 deaths; 95% UI: 99,964 to 108,002), high SBP (98,923 deaths; 95%UI: 92,912 to 104,609) and high body-mass index (BMI) (42,643 deaths; 95%UI: 40,161 to 45,111). Conclusion suboptimal diet, high SBP, and high BMI are major causes of cardiometabolic death in Brazil, informing priorities for policy initiatives. ©2016 de Oliveira Otto et al.

In contrast, little research has been devoted to analysing these practices in terms of matching the recurrent context-dependent demand for resources (labour in particular) with those available on the farm. This paper presents Dhivine, a simulation model of operational management of grape production at the vineyard scale. Particular attention focuses on representing a flexible plan, which organises activities temporally, the resources available to the vineyard manager and the process of scheduling and executing the activities. The model relies on a generic production-system ontology used in several agricultural production domains. The types of investigations that the model supports are briefly illustrated. The enhanced realism of the production-management situations simulated makes it possible to examine and understand properties of resource-constrained work-organisation strategies and possibilities for improving them. © 2016 Martin-Clouaire et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"attention; grape; human; manager; model; ontology; vineyard; agriculture; algorithm; crop; environmental protection; growth, development and aging; pest control; physiology; procedures; theoretical model; Vitis; Agriculture; Algorithms; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Models, Theoretical; Pest Control; Vitis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962082022

There are several studies in the literature with the aim of finding the best method to assess and map the distribution of SOC content for Europe. Therefore this study aims searching for another aspect of this issue by looking to the performances of using aggregated soil samples coming from different studies and land-uses. The total number of the soil samples in this study was 23,835 and they're collected from the ""Land Use/Cover Area frame Statistical Survey"" (LUCAS) Project (samples from agricultural soil), BioSoil Project (samples from forest soil), and ""Soil Transformations in European Catchments"" (SoilTrEC) Project (samples from local soil data coming from six different critical zone observatories (CZOs) in Europe). Moreover, 15 spatial indicators (slope, aspect, elevation, compound topographic index (CTI), CORINE land-cover classification, parent material, texture, world reference base (WRB) soil classification, geological formations, annual average temperature, min-max temperature, total precipitation and average precipitation (for years 1960-1990 and 2000-2010)) were used as auxiliary variables in this prediction. One of the most popular geostatistical techniques, Regression-Kriging (RK), was applied to build the model and assess the distribution of SOC. This study showed that, even though RK method was appropriate for successful SOC mapping, using combined databases was not helpful to increase the statistical significance of the method results for assessing the SOC distribution. According to our results; SOC variation was mainly affected by elevation, slope, CTI, average temperature, average and total precipitation, texture, WRB and CORINE variables for Europe scale in our model. Moreover, the highest average SOC contents were found in the wetland areas; agricultural areas have much lower soil organic carbon content than forest and semi natural areas; Ireland, Sweden and Finland has the highest SOC, on the contrary, Portugal, Poland, Hungary, Spain, Italy have the lowest values with the average 3%. © 2016 Aksoy et al.

A two-fold scheme is developed for (1) knowledge acquisition through searching input–output patterns of optimal reservoir operation by optimization methods and (2) the inference system through mapping the current input pattern to estimate the water shortage rate by artificial neural networks (ANNs). The Shihmen Reservoir in northern Taiwan is the study case. We first design nine possible water demand conditions by investigating the changes in historical water supply. With the nine designed conditions and 44-year historical 10-day reservoir inflow data collected during the growth season (3 months) of the first paddy crop, we first conduct the optimization search of reservoir operation by using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) in consideration of agricultural and public water demands simultaneously. The simulation method is used as a comparative model to the NSGA-II. Results demonstrate that the NSGA-II can suitably search the optimal water allocation series and obtain much lower seasonal water shortage rates than those of the simulation method. Then seasonal water shortage rates in response to future water demands for both sectors are estimated by using the adaptive network fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is adopted as a comparative model to the ANFIS. During model construction, future water demands, predicted monthly inflows (or seasonal inflow) of the reservoir in the next coming quarter and historical initial reservoir storages configure the input patterns while the optimal seasonal water shortage rates obtained from the NSGA-II serve as output targets (training targets) for both neural networks. Results indicate that the ANFIS and the BPNN models produce almost equally good performance in estimating water shortage rates, yet the ANFIS model produces even better stability. The reliability of the proposed scheme is further examined by scenario analysis. The scenario analysis indicates that an increase in public water demand or a decrease in agricultural water demand would bring more impacts of water supply on agricultural sectors than public sectors. Similarly, a bigger decrease in inflow amount would obviously bring more influence on agricultural sectors than public one. Consequently, given predicted inflow, decision makers can pre-experience the possible outcomes in response to competing water demands through the estimation models in order to determine adequate water supply as well as preparedness measures, if needed, for drought mitigation. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Adaptive network fuzzy inference system (ANFIS); Artificial neural network (ANN); Back-propagation neural network (BPNN); Multi-objective reservoir operation; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II); Water allocation","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Decision making; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Inference engines; Neural networks; Optimization; Reliability analysis; Reservoirs (water); Resource allocation; Sorting; Torsional stress; Water supply; Adaptive network fuzzy inference systems; Back-propagation neural networks; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Reservoir operation; Water allocations; Water resources; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; back propagation; genetic algorithm; optimization; reservoir; resource allocation; water resource; Shihmen Reservoir; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957429772

Agriculture is the second highest sector for water consumption in the Gaza Strip, using more than 50% of water abstractions from the stressed polluted Gaza's coastal aquifer. This paper aims to present and evaluate two available wastewater post-treatment options which could be employed to reuse wastewater for agriculture in Gaza: sand filtration using a textured geo-membrane sand filter and the Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) system. This evaluation is based on applying hierarchy grey relational analysis and the comparison matrix through an environmental assessment for each option using a semi-empirical methodology that combines results from field tests and computer hydrological simulations. In addition, it is based on a social and economic and the operational aspects for the Gaza City Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and its infiltration basin. The evaluation factors for the two options are juxtaposed in a Comparison Matrix with associated weighted scores and pre-defined scales to quantify the evaluation process before using the hierarchy grey relational analysis. The results show that the operational costs and the environmental aspects are the main factors that affect the evaluation process for wastewater post-treatment options. The sand filtration (with textured geo-membrane) option is ranked higher than the SAT system for this particular case study with an overall integrated grey relational grade equal to 0.3276, compared to 0.2596 for the SAT system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Gaza; Geo-membrane; Hierarchy grey relational analysis; Sand filtration; SAT; Wastewater",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951864622

However, increasing model sophistication and accuracy-and therefore complexity-may trade-off with ease of use and applicability to real-world decision-making contexts, so it is vital to incorporate the lessons learned from implementation efforts into new model development. Using successful implementation efforts for guidance, we developed an integrated ES modelling system to quantify several ecosystem services: forest timber production and carbon storage, water purification, pollination, and biodiversity. The system is designed to facilitate uptake of ES information into land-use decisions through three principal considerations: (1) using relatively straightforward models that can be readily deployed and interpreted without specialized expertise; (2) using an agentbased modelling framework to enable the incorporation of human decision-making directly within the model; and (3) integration among all ES models to simultaneously demonstrate the effects of a single land-use decision on multiple ES. We present an implementation of the model for a major watershed in Alberta, Canada, and highlight the system's capabilities to assess a suite of ES under future management decisions, including forestry activities under two alternative timber harvest strategies, and through a scenario modelling analysis exploring different intensities of hypothetical agricultural expansion. By using a modular approach, the modelling system can be readily expanded to evaluate additional ecosystem services or management questions of interest in order to guide land-use decisions to achieve socioeconomic and environmental objectives. © 2016 Habib et al.","Agent-based modelling; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Cellular automata; Ecological economics; Ecosystem services; Land-use planning; Simulation modelling; Systems modelling; Watersheds","agriculture; Alberta; biodiversity; carbon storage; decision making; economics; forest; forestry; human; land use; model; pollination; quantitative study; water management; watershed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007292801

However, most agricultural public infrastructures are aging and deteriorating due to a lack of investment budgets for renewal projects. This study aims to evaluate future influences of deteriorated agricultural public infrastructure by using the dynamic-spatial computable-general-equilibrium (CGE) model and the prediction method of capital stocks. Features of this study include, (i) future situation of agricultural public infrastructure based on the method employed in the Cabinet Office of Japan (2012) with the first official documents on Japanese public capital stocks, (ii) the dynamic spatial CGE model used with consideration of endogenous productivity growth by agricultural public facilities, and (iii) needed public investment to keep public capital stocks at peak levels and the payment of certain sectors or all industries to secure funds for investments without an increase in public debts in Japan. The simulation results demonstrate discord between famer and national benefits caused by renovation of agricultural public infrastructures. Furthermore, the benefit-cost ratio for renovation of agricultural public infrastructures became lower than expected in local regions because of leakage effects to urban regions when renovation projects were conducted in all regions at the same time. Urban regions experienced the opposite tendency. Based on the above prediction of future situations, several policy implications for public investments can be raised. That is, maintaining public capital stocks by any counter measures is highly needed for sustainable growth of the economy. Different policies on budget sources for such measures and stock management measures can result in different economic effects, so policy simulation with a CGE model is helpful for decision makers to consider comprehensive effects of policies. © JSRSAI 2016.","Cost-benefit ratio; Inter-regional trade; Regional ripple effects; Renovation of agricultural public infrastructure; Stock management measures",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988354818

With the more intensive use of heavy machines in agriculture and forestry, the risk of soil compaction is increasing. In this study, precompression stress (Pc) was chosen as an indicator of the susceptibility of soils to compaction and was calculated using pedotransfer functions (PTFs). PTFs involve eight variables related to the hydraulic and mechanical behaviour of soils: organic matter content, bulk density, air capacity, available water capacity, non-plant available water capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, cohesion, and angle of internal friction. Combining these PTFs with geostatistics and Monte Carlo simulations, Pc maps were produced at the regional scale for Wallonia in Belgium, accompanied by uncertainty quantification maps. These maps were then used to produce compaction risk maps based on common scenarios. The results showed that the modal Pc map was coherent with the spatial distribution of the main variables, namely soil texture and organic matter content.

Yet, few studies have examined the validity and robustness of such models. This study was performed to test and refine the rules associated with a previously developed geospatial model that predicts the prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes in produce farms in New York State (NYS). Produce fields for each of four enrolled produce farms were categorized into areas of high or low predicted L. monocytogenes prevalence using rules based on a field's available water storage (AWS) and its proximity to water, impervious cover, and pastures. Drag swabs (n=1,056) were collected from plots assigned to each risk category. Logistic regression, which tested the ability of each rule to accurately predict the prevalence of L. monocytogenes, validated the rules based on water and pasture. Samples collected near water (odds ratio [OR], 3.0) and pasture (OR, 2.9) showed a significantly increased likelihood of L. monocytogenes isolation compared to that for samples collected far from water and pasture. Generalized linear mixed models identified additional land cover factors associated with an increased likelihood of L. monocytogenes isolation, such as proximity to wetlands. These findings validated a subset of previously developed rules that predict L. monocytogenes prevalence in produce production environments. This suggests that GIS and geospatial models can be used to accurately predict L. monocytogenes prevalence on farms and can be used prospectively to minimize the risk of preharvest contamination of produce. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Agriculture; Forecasting; Geographic information systems; Optical variables measurement; Pathogens; Food-borne pathogens; Generalized linear mixed models; Geospatial model; Impervious cover; Listeria monocytogenes; Logistic regressions; Production environments; Technological advancement; Listeria; bacterium; GIS; land cover; model validation; pasture; pathogen; regression analysis; risk assessment; sampling; water storage; wetland; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States; Listeria monocytogenes; agriculture; computer simulation; crop; food contamination; food control; geographic information system; isolation and purification; Listeria monocytogenes; microbiology; New York; prevalence; prevention and control; standards; statistics and numerical data; validation study; Agriculture; Computer Simulation; Crops, Agricultural; Food Contamination; Food Microbiology; Geographic Information Systems; Listeria monocytogenes; New York; Prevalence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957643733

The county-level simulation model focuses on both field crops (corn, soybean, and wheat) and biomass feedstocks (corn stover, wheat straw, switchgrass, and Miscanthus). In addition, pasture serves as a potential area for bioenergy crop production. The economic model is calibrated to 2022 in terms of yield, crop demand, and baseline prices and allocates land optimally among the alternative crops given the binding cellulosic biofuel mandate. The simulation scenarios differ in terms of bioenergy crop type (switchgrass and Miscanthus) and yield, biomass production inputs, and pasture availability. The cellulosic biofuel mandates range from 15 to 60 billion L. The results indicate that the 15 and 30 billion L mandates in the high production input scenarios for switchgrass and Miscanthus are covered entirely by agricultural residues. With the exception of the low production input for Miscanthus scenario, the share of agricultural residues is always over 50% for all other scenarios including the 60 billion L mandate. The largest proportion of agricultural land dedicated to either switchgrass or Miscanthus is found in the southern Plains and the southeast. Almost no bioenergy crops are grown in the Midwest across all scenarios. Changes in the prices for the three commodities are negligible for cellulosic ethanol mandates because most of the mandate is met with agricultural residues. The lessons learned are that (1) the share of agricultural residue in the feedstock mix is higher than previously estimated and (2) for a given mandate, the feedstock composition is relatively stable with the exception of one scenario. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Agricultural residues; Crop prices; Land use; Miscanthus; Pasture; Switchgrass","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Agronomy; Bins; Biomass; Cellulosic ethanol; Costs; Crops; Cultivation; Economics; Feedstocks; Land use; Plants (botany); Agricultural land; Biomass feedstock; Biomass productions; Cellulosic biofuels; Economic modeling; Miscanthus; Pasture; Switchgrass; Biofuels; agronomy; biofuel; biomass; commodity price; crop production; crop residue; grass; land use planning; pasture; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954380001

Traditionally a non-spatial or field trial assessment is used. In this study we exemplify the introduction of a spatial context to the ERA as well as suggest a way in which the results of complex models, necessary for proper inclusion of spatial aspects in the ERA, can be presented and evaluated easily using abundance and occupancy ratios (AOR). We used an agent-based simulation system and an existing model for a widespread carabid beetle (Bembidion lampros), to evaluate the impact of a fictitious highly-toxic pesticide on population density and the distribution of beetles in time and space. Landscape structure and field margin management were evaluated by comparing scenario-based ERAs for the beetle. Source-sink dynamics led to an off-crop impact even when no pesticide was present off-crop. In addition, the impacts increased with multi-year application of the pesticide whereas current ERA considers only maximally one year. These results further indicated a complex interaction between landscape structure and pesticide effect in time, both in-crop and off-crop, indicating the need for NTA ERA to be conducted at landscape- and multi-season temporal-scales. Use of AOR indices to compare ERA outputs facilitated easy comparison of scenarios, allowing simultaneous evaluation of impacts and planning of mitigation measures. The landscape and population ERA approach also demonstrates that there is a potential to change from regulation of a pesticide in isolation, towards the consideration of pesticide management at landscape scales and provision of biodiversity benefits via inclusion and testing of mitigation measures in authorisation procedures. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Abundance Occupancy Ratio index; ALMaSS; Bembidion lampros; Environmental risk assessment; Landscape-scale risk assessment; Source-sink dynamics","Biodiversity; Crops; Pesticide effects; Pesticides; Population statistics; Abundance Occupancy Ratio index; ALMaSS; Bembidion lampros; Environmental risk assessment; Landscape scale; Source-sink; Risk assessment; pesticide; beetle; biodiversity; environmental risk; landscape structure; pesticide; population density; population distribution; risk assessment; Article; Bembidion lampros; Carabidae; controlled study; environmental impact assessment; environmental planning; landscape; mathematical model; nonhuman; pesticide spraying; population abundance; population density; population distribution; priority journal; risk assessment; source sink relationship; agriculture; environmental protection; pollution; prevention and control; procedures; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; Europe; Arthropoda; Bembidion lampros; Carabidae; Coleoptera; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Pollution; Models, Theoretical; Pesticides; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940417285

However, yield realization tendency can vary from year to year and may depend on the correlation of yield realizations across years. When the current single-year Yield Protection (YP) and Area Risk Protection Insurance (ARPI) contracts are extended to multiple periods, actuarially fair premium rate is expected to decrease as poor yield realizations in a year can be offset by another year's better yield realizations. In this study, we first use simulations to demonstrate how significant premium savings are possible when coverage is based on the sum of yields across years rather than on a year-by-year basis. We then describe the design of a multi-year framework of crop insurance and model the insurance using a copula approach. Insurance terms are extended to more than a year and the premium, liability, and indemnity are determined by a multi-year term. Moreover, partial payment is provided at the end of each term to offset the possibility of significant loss in a single term. County-level data obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are used to demonstrate the implementations of the proposed multi-year crop insurance. The proposed multi-year plan would benefit farmers by offering insurance guarantees across years for significantly lower costs. © 2015 Chen, Goodwin.

The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 mandated the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to conduct a pilot study to assess the impact of making fruits and vegetables more affordable for households in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Based on the USDA final report of the Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP), a large-scale randomized trial in 2011-2012 that provided 30% rebate on targeted fruits and vegetables to 7500 study participants enrolled in the SNAP, we constructed a decision model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an expansion of the HIP to all SNAP households nationwide. The estimated life-time per capita costs of the HIP to the Federal government is $1323 in 2012 U.S. dollars, and the average gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy to a SNAP participant is 0.082 quality-adjusted life year (QALY), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $16,172 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulations indicates a 94.4% and 99.6% probability that the estimated ICER would be lower than the cost-effective threshold of $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY gained, respectively. Moreover, the estimated ICER of the HIP expansion tends to be competitive in comparison to other interventions that aimed at promoting fruit/vegetable intake among adult population. Findings from this study suggest that a nationwide expansion of the HIP is likely to nudge SNAP households towards purchasing and consuming more targeted fruits and vegetables. However, diet behavior modification is proportional to price change. When people's actual eating behaviors and what dietary guidelines recommend differ by several folds, even a 30% rebate closes just a small fraction of that gap and has limited beneficial impact on participants' weight management, disease prevention, and health-related quality of life. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cost-effectiveness analysis; Diet; Financial incentive; Fruit; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; United States; Vegetable","cost analysis; diet; finance; fruit; incentive; nutrition; social policy; vegetable; adult; aged; Article; behavior modification; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; feeding behavior; food intake; fruit vegetable; functional assessment; government regulation; household; human; life expectancy; middle aged; Monte Carlo method; mortality; pilot study; practice guideline; probability; program cost effectiveness; program effectiveness; quality adjusted life year; sensitivity analysis; very elderly; young adult; commercial phenomena; cost benefit analysis; decision support system; economics; female; food assistance; fruit; health behavior; health promotion; male; motivation; poverty; United States; vegetable; United States; Adult; Commerce; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Support Techniques; Female; Food Assistance; Food Habits; Fruit; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Pilot Projects; Poverty; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; United States; Vegetables",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946426409

Design/methodology/approach – The authors conducted a mixed-mode survey in January- February 2010. Data were analyzed using a bivariate probit model, considering that the decision to adopt platforms was related with the orchard planting system. The authors conducted simulation scenarios to estimate the efficiencies – harvest – platforms must achieve in order to be economically feasible. Findings – In total, 11 percent of the 316 apple operations covered by the survey used platforms. Orchard operations most likely to invest in planar structures are relatively large, produce high-value varieties, use organic systems, and have relatively young and educated operators. Similarly, operations producing high-value fruit such as “Honeycrisp” and controlled or patented varieties and relatively large operations are more likely to invest in platforms. The results of the comparison of the cost of harvesting apples using platforms vs ladders under several production assumptions indicate that platforms must increase labor productivity by at least 13 percent in order to be adopted by the industry. Research limitations/implications – This study caveat is the lack of inclusion of production and marketing uncertainties in the estimation of future apple harvest costs. Further research to deeper analyze these issues is needed. Practical implications – The authors present information on the profile of mechanization adopters, so extension educators and engineers could concentrate efforts on them to increase adoption levels. In addition the authors provide a threshold of efficiencies for harvest platforms associated with cost savings compared to manual harvest. Social implications – Enabling the adoption of mechanization technologies by specialty crop industries would decrease the dependence on labor, decreasing labor uncertainties and facilitating the production of high quality produce to satisfy the needs of consumers. Second, it will end an era of importing poverty, given that the specialty crop industry has long benefited from seasonal migrant workers.

We developed a spatial microsimulation model called the Farm Location and Agricultural Production Simulator (FLAPS) that simulated the distribution and populations of individual livestock farms throughout the conterminous U.S. Using domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) as an example species, we customized iterative proportional-fitting algorithms for the hierarchical structure of the U.S. Census of Agriculture and imputed unpublished state-or county-level livestock population totals that were redacted to ensure confidentiality. We used a weighted sampling design to collect data on the presence and absence of farms and used them to develop a national-scale distribution model that predicted the distribution of individual farms at a 100 m resolution. We implemented microsimulation algorithms that simulated the populations and locations of individual farms using output from our imputed Census of Agriculture dataset and distribution model. Approximately 19% of county-level pig population totals were unpublished in the 2012 Census of Agriculture and needed to be imputed. Using aerial photography, we confirmed the presence or absence of livestock farms at 10,238 locations and found livestock farms were correlated with open areas, cropland, and roads, and also areas with cooler temperatures and gentler topography. The distribution of swine farms was highly variable, but cross-validation of our distribution model produced an area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve value of 0.78, which indicated good predictive performance. Verification analyses showed FLAPS accurately imputed and simulated Census of Agriculture data based on absolute percent difference values of < 0.01% at the state-to-national scale, 3.26% for the county-to-state scale, and 0.03% for the individual farm-to-county scale.

Remaining grasslands are increasingly fragmented, mostly privately owned, and vary greatly in terms of habitat quality and protection status. A coordinated strategic response for grassland bird conservation is difficult, largely due to the scope and complexity of the problem, further compounded by biological, sociological, and economic uncertainties. We describe the results from a collaborative Structured Decision Making (SDM) workshop focused on linking social and economic drivers of landscape change to grassland bird population outcomes. We identified and evaluated alternative strategies for grassland bird conservation using a series of rapid prototype models. We modeled change in grassland and agriculture cover in hypothetical landscapes resulting from different landowner decisions in response to alternative socio-economic conservation policy decisions. Resulting changes in land cover at all three stages of the annual cycle (breeding, wintering, and migration) were used to estimate changes in grassland bird populations. Our results suggest that successful grassland bird conservation may depend upon linkages with ecosystem services on working agricultural lands and grassland-based marketing campaigns to engage the public. With further development, spatial models that link landowner decisions with biological outcomes can be essential tools for making conservation policy decisions. A coordinated non-traditional partnership will likely be necessary to clearly understand and systematically respond to the many conservation challenges facing grassland birds. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

It allows users to simulate complex socio-environmental couplings in groundwater systems, and to explore how desirable patterns of groundwater and social development can emerge from agent behaviours and interactions. GW-ABMs can be developed using a single piece of software, addressing common issues around data transfer and model analyses that arise when linking ABMs to existing groundwater codes. FlowLogo is based on a 2D finite-difference solution of the governing groundwater flow equations and a set of procedures to represent the most common types of stresses and boundary conditions of regional aquifer flow. The platform is illustrated using a synthetic example of an expanding agricultural region that depends on groundwater for irrigation. The implementation and analysis of scenarios from this example highlight the possibility to: (i) deploy agents at multiple scales of decision-making (farmers, waterworks, institutions), (ii) model feedbacks between agent behaviours and groundwater dynamics, and (iii) perform sensitivity and multi-realisation analyses on social and physical factors. The FlowLogo interface allows interactively changing parameters using 'tuneable' dials, which can adjust agent decisions and policy levers during simulations. This flexibility allows for live interaction with audiences (role-plays), in participatory workshops, public meetings, and as part of learning activities in classrooms. FlowLogo's interactive features and ease of use aim to facilitate the wider dissemination and independent validation of GW-ABMs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Agent-based models; Complexity; Groundwater management; NetLogo; Participatory modelling; Social simulation","Agriculture; Aquifers; Autonomous agents; Behavioral research; Computational methods; Data transfer; Decision making; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Water management; Agent-based model; Complexity; Groundwater management; NetLogo; Participatory modelling; Social simulations; Groundwater resources; aquifer; boundary condition; complexity; decision making; groundwater; groundwater flow; hydrological modeling; learning; model validation; nature-society relations; participatory approach; software",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941043038

During the past 40 years, much research on pearl millet production practices and adoption in this region has been conducted, but an attempt to summarize these results has not been previously completed and these research results are not readily available to many West African scientists. This review was completed to address this need and integrate knowledge, and at the same time identify research needs for the future and extension priorities for semi-arid West African agro-ecological zones. Research has shown that selection of improved varieties and cropping systems, appropriate cultural practices, and recommended integrated soil, nutrient, residue and pest management can greatly increase grain and stover yields of pearl millet. However, adoption by farmers has been minimal due to limited profitability, high risk and labour demand, limited input supply, market availability and appropriate public policy. This review has 196 articles included as in-text citations (Table 1) compared to 149 articles in the reference list, indicating that only one in four articles integrated two or more topics in the research. The obvious conclusion is that most of the past research has not addressed the 'system' but rather one or two management practices. In addition, most studies have interpreted responses in terms of yield without addressing other important considerations for farmer adoption. Recent conservation agriculture research moves closer to addressing the larger integrative types of research needed. Such research is complex and requires sustained funding for field and laboratory activities, but also for computer simulation modelling and economic assessment. © 2015 Cambridge University Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941414362

As such, determining the routes and modality of introductions with genetic data has become a fundamental goal in molecular ecology. To assist with this goal, new statistical methods and frameworks have been developed, such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) for inferring invasion history. Here, we present a model of invasion accounting for multiple introductions from a single source (MISS), a heretofore largely unexplored model. We simulate microsatellite data to evaluate the power of ABC to distinguish between single and multiple introductions from the same source, under a range of demographic parameters. We also apply ABC to microsatellite data from three invasions of bumblebee in New Zealand. In addition, we assess the performance of several methods of summary statistics selection. Our simulated results suggested good ability to distinguish between one- and two-wave models over much but not all of the parameter space tested, independent of summary statistics used. Globally, parameter estimation was good except for bottleneck timing. For one of the bumblebee species, we clearly rejected the MISS model, while for the other two we found inconclusive results. Since a second wave may provide genetic reinforcement to initial colonists, help relieve inbreeding among founders, or increase the hazard of the invasion, its detection may be crucial for managing invasions; we suggest that the MISS model could be considered as a potential model in future theoretical and empirical studies of invasions. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",,"Bayesian analysis; bee; biological invasion; DNA; genetic analysis; inbreeding; invasive species; population bottleneck; simulation; statistical analysis; New Zealand; microsatellite DNA; animal; Bayes theorem; bee; biological model; ecology; genetics; introduced species; New Zealand; population genetics; procedures; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Bees; Ecology; Genetics, Population; Introduced Species; Microsatellite Repeats; Models, Genetic; New Zealand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939258960

That includes also emissions from agricultural sector. Although the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has established a methodology for assessment of GHG emissions from agriculture, the forecasting options are limited, especially when policies and their interaction with the agricultural system are tested. Therefore, an advanced tool, a system dynamics model, was developed that enables assessment of effects various decisions and measures have on agricultural GHG emissions. The model is based on the IPCC guidelines and includes the main elements of an agricultural system, i.e. land management, livestock farming, soil fertilization and crop production, as well as feedback mechanisms between the elements. The case of Latvia is selected for simulations, as agriculture generates 22% of the total anthropogenic GHG emissions in the country. The results demonstrate that there are very limited options for GHG mitigation in the agricultural sector. Thereby, reaching the non-ETS GHG emission targets will be very challenging for Latvia, as the level of agricultural GHG emissions will be exceeded considerably above the target levels. Thus, other non-ETS sectors will have to reduce their emissions drastically to ""neutralize"" the agricultural sector's emissions for reaching the EU's common ambition to move towards low-carbon economy. The developed model may serve as a decision support tool for impact assessment of various measures and decisions on the agricultural system's GHG emissions.

After compensating for random error, the probability distributions of farm-level yields are simulated with characteristic yields based on the linear additive model. The premium rate is calculated based on Monte Carlo yield simulation results. This method was applied to Dingxing County, North China to arrive at the insurance loss cost ratio and calculate the necessary premium rate.

However, the benefits of BMP implementation on receiving water quality at multiple spatial is an ongoing challenge. In this paper, we introduce an integrated approach that combines risk assessment (i.e., Phosphorus (P) index), model simulation techniques (Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN), and a BMP placement tool at various scales to identify the optimal location for implementing multiple BMPs and estimate BMP effectiveness after implementation. A statistically significant decrease in nutrient discharge from watersheds is proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of BMPs, strategically targeted within watersheds. Specifically, we estimate two types of cost-effectiveness curves (total pollution reduction and proportion of watersheds improved) for four allocation approaches. Selection of a ""best approach"" depends on the relative importance of the two types of effectiveness, which involves a value judgment based on the random/aggregated degree of BMP distribution among and within sub-watersheds. A statistical optimization framework is developed and evaluated in Chaohe River Watershed located in the northern mountain area of Beijing. Results show that BMP implementation significantly (p >0.001) decrease P loss from the watershed. Remedial strategies where BMPs were targeted to areas of high risk of P loss, deceased P loads compared with strategies where BMPs were randomly located across watersheds. Sensitivity analysis indicated that aggregated BMP placement in particular watershed is the most cost-effective scenario to decrease P loss. The optimization approach outlined in this paper is a spatially hierarchical method for targeting nonpoint source controls across a range of scales from field to farm, to watersheds, to regions. Further, model estimates showed targeting at multiple scales is necessary to optimize program efficiency. The integrated model approach described that selects and places BMPs at varying levels of implementation, provides a new theoretical basis and technical guidance for diffuse pollution management in agricultural watersheds.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

This review identifies knowledge gaps and shows the need for more research into genetic diversity changes under plant breeding. Abstract: Modern plant breeding has made a profound impact on food production and will continue to play a vital role in world food security. For sustainable agriculture, a compromise should be sought between maximizing crop yield under changing climate and minimizing crop failure under unfavorable conditions. Such a compromise requires better understanding of the impacts of plant breeding on crop genetic diversity. Efforts have been made over the last three decades to assess crop genetic diversity using molecular marker technologies. However, these assessments have revealed some temporal diversity patterns that are largely inconsistent with our perception that modern plant breeding reduces crop genetic diversity. An attempt was made in this review to explain such discrepancies by examining empirical assessments of crop genetic diversity and theoretical investigations of genetic diversity changes over time under artificial selection. It was found that many crop genetic diversity assessments were not designed to assess diversity impacts from specific plant breeding programs, while others were experimentally inadequate and contained technical biases from the sampling of cultivars and genomes. Little attention has been paid to theoretical investigations on crop genetic diversity changes from plant breeding. A computer simulation of five simplified breeding schemes showed the substantial effects of plant breeding on the retention of heterozygosity over generations. It is clear that more efforts are needed to investigate crop genetic diversity in space and time under plant breeding to achieve sustainable crop production. © 2015, The Author(s).",,"Biodiversity; Crops; Cultivation; Food supply; Forestry; Plants (botany); Artificial selection; Changing climate; Empirical assessment; Genetic diversity; Plant breeding programs; Sustainable agriculture; Temporal diversity; Theoretical investigations; Agriculture; biological model; computer simulation; crop; genetic selection; genetic variation; genetics; heterozygote; plant breeding; Computer Simulation; Crops, Agricultural; Genetic Variation; Heterozygote; Models, Genetic; Plant Breeding; Selection, Genetic",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945457462

It is important to estimate obesity prevalence at the local level to target programmatic and policy interventions. It is challenging, however, to obtain local estimates of obesity prevalence because national health surveys such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) are not designed to produce direct estimates at the local levels (e.g. census tracts) due to small population samples and the need to preserve individual confidentiality. In this study we address the problem of estimating local obesity prevalence rates by implementing a spatial microsimulation modeling technique to proportionally replicate the demographic characteristics of BRFSS respondents to census tract populations in metropolitan Detroit. Obesity prevalence rates are examined for high and low spatial clusters and studied in relation to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) measures of low-income neighborhoods and local food deserts and CDC's measure of healthy and less healthy food environments currently used to target obesity reduction initiatives. This study found that obesity prevalence was largely clustered in the City of Detroit extending north into contiguous suburbs. The spatial patterns of highest obesity prevalence tracts were most similarly aligned with USDA-defined low-income tracts and CDC's less healthy food tracts. The locations of USDA's food desert tracts rarely overlapped with the highest obesity prevalence tracts. This study demonstrated a new methodology by which to assess local areas in need of future obesity interventions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS); Obesity; Small area estimation; Spatial microsimulation; Urban health","census; low income population; metropolitan area; obesity; public health; risk factor; simulation; Detroit; Michigan; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928647712

Periods of low precipitation often lead to increased, unsustainable reliance on groundwater-supplied irrigation. As a result, regional water management agencies place limits on the amount of water which can be obtained from groundwater, requiring farmers to reduce acreage for more water-intensive crops or remove them from the portfolio entirely. Real-time decisions must be made by the farmer to ensure viability of their farming operation and reduce the impacts associated with limited water resources. Evolutionary algorithms, coupled with accurate, flexible, realistic simulation tools, are ideal mechanisms to allow farmers to assess scenarios with regard to multiple, competing objectives. In order to effective, however, one must be able to select among a variety of simulation tools and optimization algorithms. Many simulation tools allow no access to the source code, and many optimization algorithms are now packaged as part of a suite of tools available to a user. In this work, we describe a framework for integrating these different software components using only their associated input and output streams. We analyze our strategy by coupling a multi-objective genetic algorithm available in the DAKOTA optimization suite (developed and distributed by Sandia National Laboratory) with the MODFLOW-FMP2 simulation tool (developed and distributed by the United States Geological Survey). MODFLOW-FMP2 has been used extensively to model hydrological and farming processes in agriculture-dominated regions, allowing us to represent both farming and conservation interests. We evaluate our integration by considering a case study related to planting decisions facing farmers experiencing water stress. We present numerical results for three competing objectives associated with stakeholders in a given region (i.e., profitability, meeting demand targets, and water conservation). The data obtained from the optimization are robust with respect to algorithmic parameter choices, validating the ability of the associated evolutionary algorithm to perform well without expert guidance. This is integral to our approach, as a motivation for this work is providing decision-making tools. In addition, the results from this study demonstrate that output from the chosen evolutionary algorithm provides a suite of feasible planting scenarios, giving farmers and policy makers the ability to compromise solutions based on realistic simulation data. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Farm management; Multi-objective; Simulation-based optimization","Agriculture; Algorithms; Computational complexity; Crops; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Evolutionary algorithms; Groundwater; Optimization; Water conservation; Water management; Water resources; Decision-making frameworks; Farm management; Multi objective; Multi-objective genetic algorithm; Optimization algorithms; Sandia National Laboratories; Simulation-based optimizations; United states geological surveys; Multiobjective optimization; agricultural management; drought stress; genetic algorithm; intensive agriculture; irrigation system; multiobjective programming; optimization; software; trade-off; water management; water stress",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930376812

Adopting Integrated Water Resources Management principles will ensure that the implementation of wastewater reuse projects will take into account all the various types of affected stakeholders, accounting in addition for the external costs and benefits derived from the reuse decision. The objective of this paper is to analyze the economic, social and environmental aspects surrounding the concept of wastewater reuse in order to assist policy-makers and managers on the implementation of economic instruments for decision-making. This study proposes a methodological framework for conducting cost-benefit analysis, which is later exemplified by the Yarqon Recycling Project case study in Israel. In this case study application, 3 different scenarios (""pessimistic"", ""base-case"" and ""optimistic"") with a range of parameters values, were used to estimate the most relevant internal and external costs and benefits. Additionally, the most influential parameters were identified using a sensitivity analysis that included both Monte Carlo simulations and the standardized regression coefficients method. For the ""base-case"" scenario, the net present value obtained was approximately $4.83 million. Although the feasibility of the project is demonstrated, the sensitivity analysis results were less favorable (likelihood of obtaining a positive result was only 64.28%), being the external recreational costs derived from irrigating with reclaimed wastewater the most influential parameter. The results of this analysis led to the conclusion that including the relevant externalities might have a strong impact on the economic feasibility of the wastewater reuse projects. The proposed methodological framework aims to guide decision-makers in evaluating their success with respect to Integrated Water Resources Management in economic terms. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

During the last decades, the lake area has seen extensive degradation in terms of water quality, erosion, deforestation, and biodiversity concomitant with a major shift to unsustainable land use. The study was conducted, with an emphasis on water quality, to analyze environmental impacts (effects) changing the ecosystem and to comprehensively evaluate the environmental state of the ecosystem through an innovative Rapid Cumulative Effects Assessment framework tool. The assessment started with a framework-forming Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), which quantified and prioritized impacts over space and time. Critically important impacts were assessed for “intra-inter interactions” using the loop analysis simulation. Water samples were analyzed while geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing were used to identify water pollution hotspots. It was concluded that out of a plethora of impacts, pollution from municipal sources, sedimentation, and effects exerted by floating gardens had the most detrimental impacts, which cumulatively affected the entire ecosystem. The framework tool was designed in a broad sense with a reference to highly needed assessments of poorly studied wetlands where degradation is evident, but scarcely quantified, and where long-term field studies are fraught with security issues and resource unavailability (post-conflict, poor and remote regions, e.g., Afghanistan, Laos, Sudan, etc.) © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Floating gardens; Intra-inter interactions; Participatory Rural Appraisal; Remote sensing; Water quality","Biodiversity; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Lake pollution; Lakes; Land use; Quality control; Remote sensing; Space optics; Water quality; Wetlands; Cumulative effects assessments; Environmental state; Floating gardens; Loop analysis; Participatory rural appraisals; Remote regions; Security issues; Space and time; Rural areas; chlorophyll a; dissolved oxygen; environmental impact assessment; GIS; participatory rural appraisal; remote sensing; water pollution; water quality; wetland; agriculture; Article; computer simulation; environmental impact assessment; floating garden; geographic information system; lake ecosystem; Myanmar; pH; remote sensing; sedimentation; water pollution; water quality; water sampling; wetland; analysis; ecosystem; environment; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; pollution; procedures; statistics and numerical data; Inle Lake; Myanmar; Shan; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Geographic Information Systems; Myanmar; Water Pollution; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929192000

This forms part of a concerted series of actions on agriculture and salinity in Bangladesh under the UK funded Ecosystems for Poverty Alleviation programme and the British Council INSPIRE scheme. The work was undertaken by developing simulation models for soil water balances, dry season irrigation requirements and the effectiveness of the monsoon season rainfall at leaching accumulated salts. Simulations were run from 1981 to 2098 using historical climate data and a daily climate data set based on the Met Office Hadley Centre HadRM3P regional climate model. Results show that inter-seasonal and inter-annual variability are key factors that affect the viability of dry season vegetable crop growing. By the end of the 21st century the dry season is expected to be 2-3 weeks longer than now (2014). Monsoon rainfall amounts will remain the same or possibly slightly increase but it will occur over a slightly shorter wet season. Expectations of sea level rise and additional saline intrusion into groundwater aquifers mean that dry season irrigation water is likely to become more saline by the end of the 21st century. A study carried out at Barisal indicates that irrigating with water at up to 4 ppt can be sustainable. Once the dry season irrigation water quality goes above 5 ppt, the monsoon rainfall is no longer able to leach the dry season salt deposits so salt accumulation becomes significant and farm productivity will reduce by as a much as 50%, threatening the livelihoods of farmers in this region. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"ground water; rain; sea water; soil water; soil; Article; Bangladesh; carbon footprint; climate change; crop; crop production; electric conductivity; evapotranspiration; food industry; harvest; priority journal; salinity; sea level rise; simulation; soil moisture; water quality; agriculture; chemistry; soil; theoretical model; Agriculture; Bangladesh; Climate Change; Models, Theoretical; Salinity; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931034796

An evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of several nutrient loss mitigation strategies applied at the farm-scale, set primarily for reducing N and P losses and grouped by capital cost and potential ease of adoption, followed an initial baseline assessment. Grouped nutrient loss mitigation strategies were applied on an additive basis on the assumption of full adoption, and were broadly identified as 'improved nutrient management' (M1), 'improved animal productivity' (M2), and 'restricted grazing' (M3). Estimated annual nitrate-N leaching losses occurring under representative baseline sheep and beef (cattle) farms, and representative baseline dairy farms for the region were 10±2 and 32±6kgN/ha (mean±standard deviation), respectively. Both sheep and beef and dairy farms were responsive to N leaching loss mitigation strategies in M1, at a low cost per kg N-loss mitigated. Only dairy farms were responsive to N leaching loss abatement from adopting M2, at no additional cost per kg N-loss mitigated. Dairy farms were also responsive to N leaching loss abatement from adopting M3, but this reduction came at a greater cost per kg N-loss mitigated. Only dairy farms were responsive to P-loss mitigation strategies, in particular by adopting M1. Only dairy farms were responsive to GHG abatement; greater abatement was achieved by the most intensified dairy farm system simulated. Overall, M1 provided for high levels of regional scale N- and P-loss abatement at a low cost per farm without affecting overall farm production, M2 provided additional N-loss abatement but only marginal P-loss abatement, whereas M3 provided the greatest N-loss abatement, but delivered no additional P abatement, and came at a large financial cost to farmers, sheep and beef farmers in particular. The modelling approach provides a farm-scale framework that can be extended to other regions to accommodate different farm production systems and performances, capturing the interactions between farm types, land use capabilities and production levels, as these influence nutrient losses and GHG emissions, and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Beef; Dairy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Nitrogen losses; Phosphorous losses; Sheep","dairy farming; environmental economics; gas flow; greenhouse gas; leaching; nutrient loss; pastoralism; sustainability; agricultural worker; Article; carbon footprint; cost effectiveness analysis; dairy cattle; dairying; land use; leaching; New Zealand; nutrient; nutrient management; water management; agriculture; animal; bovine; chemistry; cost benefit analysis; economics; environmental protection; greenhouse effect; prevention and control; procedures; sheep; waste management; New Zealand; South Island; Southland; Animalia; Bos; Ovis aries; carbon dioxide; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; phosphorus; water; Agriculture; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Cattle; Conservation of Natural Resources; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Greenhouse Effect; New Zealand; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Sheep; Waste Management; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927762328

In this study, after identifying lake watershed system processes, we developed a system dynamics modeling framework for managing lake water quality at the watershed scale. Two reinforcing loops (Development and Investment Promotion) and three balancing loops (Pollution, Resource Consumption, and Pollution Control) were constituted. Based on this work, we constructed Stock and Flow Diagrams that embedded a pollutant load model and a lake water quality model into a socioeconomic system dynamics model. The Dianchi Lake in Yunnan Province, China, which is the sixth largest and among the most severely polluted freshwater lakes in China, was employed as a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Water quality parameters considered in the model included chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP). The business-as-usual (BAU) scenario and three alternative management scenarios on spatial adjustment of industries and population (S1), wastewater treatment capacity construction (S2), and structural adjustment of agriculture (S3), were simulated to assess the effectiveness of certain policies in improving water quality. Results showed that S2 is most effective scenario, and the COD, TN, and TP concentrations in Caohai in 2030 are 52.5, 10.9, and 0.8mg/L, while those in Waihai are 9.6, 1.2, and 0.08mg/L, with sustained development in the watershed.

The associated increase in demand for land, water resources, and rich foods will deepen the challenge of sustainably feeding the population and balancing agricultural and environmental policies. We combine a hydrologic model with an economic model to project China's future food trade patterns and embedded water resources by 2030 and to analyze the effects of targeted irrigation reductions on this system, notably on national agricultural water consumption and food self-sufficiency. We simulate interprovincial and international food trade with a general equilibrium welfare model and a linear programming optimization, and we obtain province-level estimates of commodities' virtual water content with a hydrologic model. We find that reducing irrigated land in regions highly dependent on scarce river flow and nonrenewable groundwater resources, such as Inner Mongolia and the greater Beijing area, can improve the efficiency of agriculture and trade regarding water resources. It can also avoid significant consumption of irrigation water across China (up to 14.8 km3/y, reduction by 14%), while incurring relatively small decreases in national food self-sufficiency (e.g., by 3% for wheat). Other researchers found that a national, rather than local, water policywould have similar effects on food production but would only reduce irrigation water consumption by 5%. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

However, recent studies point out production tradeoffs that often prevent the adoption of such practices by farmers. Our study shows with the example of organic banana production in Ecuador that economic tradeoffs depend much on the approach of the analysis. We test, if organic banana should be included in economic land-use portfolios, which indicate how much of the land is provided for which type of land-use. We use time series data for productivity and prices over 30 years to compute the economic return (as annualized net present value) and its volatility (with standard deviation as risk measure) for eight crops to derive land-use portfolios for different levels of risk, which maximize economic return. We find that organic banana is included in land-use portfolios for almost every level of accepted risk with proportions from 1% to maximally 32%, even if the same high uncertainty as for conventional banana is simulated for organic banana. A more realistic, lower simulated price risk increased the proportion of organic banana substantially to up to 57% and increased annual economic returns by up to US$ 187 per ha. Under an assumed integration of both markets, for organic and conventional banana, simulated by an increased coefficient of correlation of economic return from organic and conventional banana (ρ up to +0.7), organic banana holds significant portions in the land-use portfolios tested only, if a low price risk of organic banana is considered. We conclude that uncertainty is a key issue for the adoption of organic banana. As historic data support a low price risk for organic banana compared to conventional banana, Ecuadorian farmers should consider organic banana as an advantageous land-use option in their land-use portfolios. © 2015 Castro et al.",,"agricultural land; agricultural worker; Article; banana; controlled study; correlation coefficient; economic aspect; Ecuador; organic farming; process optimization; productivity; risk assessment; risk factor; simulation; commercial phenomena; economics; growth, development and aging; Musa; natural resource; organic farming; risk; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; supply and distribution; Commerce; Ecuador; Models, Statistical; Musa; Natural Resources; Organic Agriculture; Risk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925879618

For Syria, a country marked by poor governance and unsustainable agricultural and environmental policies, the drought had a catalytic effect, contributing to political unrest. We show that the recent decrease in Syrian precipitation is a combination of natural variability and a long-term drying trend, and the unusual severity of the observed drought is here shown to be highly unlikely without this trend. Precipitation changes in Syria are linked to rising mean sea-level pressure in the Eastern Mediterranean, which also shows a long-term trend. There has been also a long-term warming trend in the Eastern Mediterranean, adding to the drawdown of soil moisture. No natural cause is apparent for these trends, whereas the observed drying and warming are consistent with model studies of the response to increases in greenhouse gases. Furthermore, model studies show an increasingly drier and hotter future mean climate for the Eastern Mediterranean. Analyses of observations and model simulations indicate that a drought of the severity and duration of the recent Syrian drought, which is implicated in the current conflict, has become more than twice as likely as a consequence of human interference in the climate system.","Climate change; Conflict; Drought; Syria; Unrest","ground water; rain; advection; agriculture; Article; climate change; drought; environmental planning; evaporation; greenhouse gas; harvest; human; Middle East; migration; precipitation; priority journal; sea level; soil moisture; Syrian; temperature; warming; geography; season; Syrian Arab Republic; time factor; Climate Change; Droughts; Geography; Rain; Seasons; Syria; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925321726

We apply the model to 35 years' worth of longitudinal demographic and economic data collected in the irrigated-rice growing village of Na Savang in northern Laos. When appropriate controls are included for other household variables, unobserved inter-household heterogeneity, and changes in local conditions and national policy over the study period, the analysis suggests that a unit increase in the household's consumer/producer ratio induces something like a nine-fold increase in the risk of death among household members aged less than five years.

The positive influence of education on growth is supported by many empirical studies. However, the effects of education on labour supply, poverty reduction and welfare as well as subsistence agriculture are hardly traceable in an econometric set-up, given the complex interactions and the long-term nature of education. An economy-wide dynamic simulation model provides a well-suited toolkit to analyse the effects of increased school provision in these aspects and provides insights into the intertemporal aspects of the schooling decision of children. We develop a macroeconomic model that explicitly includes education and human capital allocation, and takes into account that the possibility of child labour increases the opportunity costs of human capital formation. In an application for Tanzania, we find that a large-scale investment programme in education might have a negative effect on both gross domestic product (GDP) growth and high-skilled labour supply in the short term but leads to higher GDP and welfare as well as significantly reduced child labour supply in the medium to long term. © 2014 Economic Society of South Africa.","aid; computable general equilibrium; distribution; Education; I28; labour force; O15; O29; production structure; public investment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925681587

Investigations were performed to determine how climatic variability influences irrigation and whether this adaptive measure actually reduces producers' vulnerability to climate change. We used a simultaneous equations model with endogenous switching to account for the heterogeneity in the decision of whether to use adaptive measures. We compared the expected land values under the actual and counterfactual cases of farm households that either adapt or do not adapt to climate change. Simulation results show that irrigation can be an effective tool for counteracting the harmful effects of climate change. The income of farmers tends to increase on lands where irrigation technologies are practiced. These conclusions confirm the need to invest in adaptation strategies to prepare Brazil for coping with the adverse effects of global climate change.

Mounting empirical evidence suggests that changes in Brazilian law enforcement strategy and the related governance system may account for a large share of the overall success in curbing deforestation rates. At the same time, Brazil is experimenting with alternative approaches to compensate farmers for conservation actions through economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services, at various administrative levels. We develop a spatially explicit simulation model for deforestation decisions in response to policy incentives and disincentives. The model builds on elements of optimal enforcement theory and introduces the notion of imperfect payment contract enforcement in the context of avoided deforestation. We implement the simulations using official deforestation statistics and data collected from field-based forest law enforcement operations in the Amazon region. We show that a large-scale integration of payments with the existing regulatory enforcement strategy involves a tradeoff between the cost-effectiveness of forest conservation and landholder incomes. Introducing payments as a complementary policy measure increases policy implementation cost, reduces income losses for those hit hardest by law enforcement, and can provide additional income to some land users. The magnitude of the tradeoff varies in space, depending on deforestation patterns, conservation opportunity and enforcement costs. Enforcement effectiveness becomes a key determinant of efficiency in the overall policy mix. © 2015 Börner et al.",,"Article; Brazil; budget; conceptual framework; cost effectiveness analysis; deforestation; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental protection; forest; income; land use; law enforcement; mathematical model; probability; process model; reward; agriculture; compensation; economics; environment; environmental protection; government regulation; human; legislation and jurisprudence; statistical model; Daucus carota; Agriculture; Brazil; Compensation and Redress; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environment; Environmental Policy; Forests; Government Regulation; Humans; Income; Law Enforcement; Models, Statistical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922350004

The Middle Suwannee River Basin (MSRB) is of special concern because of prevalent karst topography, unconfined aquifers and sandy soils which increase vulnerability of the ground water contamination from agricultural operations- a billion dollar industry in this region. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production poses a challenge in the area due to the shallow root system of potato plants, and low water and nutrient holding capacity of the sandy soils. A four-year monitoring study for potato production on sandy soil was conducted on a commercial farm located in the MSRB to identify major nitrogen (N) loss pathways and determine their contribution to the total environmental N load, using a partial N budget approach and the potato model SUBSTOR. Model simulated environmental N loading rates were found to lie within one standard deviation of the observed values and identified leaching loss of N as the major sink representing 25 to 38% (or 85 to 138 kg ha-1 N) of the total input N (310 to 349 kg ha-1 N). The crop residues left in the field after tuber harvest represented a significant amount of N (64 to 110 kg ha-1N) and posed potential for indirect leaching loss of N upon their mineralization and the absence of subsequent cover crops. Typically, two months of fallow period exits between harvest of tubers and planting of the fall row crop (silage corn). The fallow period is characterized by summer rains which pose a threat to N released from rapidly mineralizing potato vines. Strategies to reduce N loading into the groundwater from potato production must focus on development and adoption of best management practices aimed on reducing direct as well as indirect N leaching losses. © 2015 Prasad et al.",,"ammonium nitrate; ground water; nitrate; nitrogen; rain; nitrogen; soil; air temperature; Article; comparative study; controlled study; crop management; harvest; irrigation (agriculture); nitrate leaching; nitrogen mineralization; plant tuber; pollution monitoring; potato; river basin; sandy soil; simulation; soil analysis; soil property; spring; summer; United States; water contamination; chemistry; computer simulation; crop; Florida; growth, development and aging; irrigation (agriculture); metabolism; potato; river; season; soil; sunlight; temperature; theoretical model; Solanum tuberosum; Zea mays; Agricultural Irrigation; Computer Simulation; Crops, Agricultural; Florida; Models, Theoretical; Nitrogen; Rain; Rivers; Seasons; Soil; Solanum tuberosum; Sunlight; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922360064

Some existing crop insurance schemes provide coverage against water deficits in rain-fed agriculture. The Prevented Planting Program in the USA covers against drought for irrigated agriculture. However, drought insurance for irrigated agriculture is still a challenge for companies and institutions because of the complexity of the design and implementation of this type of insurance. Few studies have attempted to evaluate the risk of loss due to irrigation water scarcity using both stand-alone production functions and crop simulation models. This paper’s contributions are that it evaluates the suitability of AquaCrop for calculating drought insurance premiums for irrigated agriculture and that it discusses contract conditions and insurance design for hydrological drought risk coverage as part of a traditional insurance product, with on-field loss assessment in combination with a trigger index. This method was applied to an irrigation district in southern Spain. Our insurance premium calculation showed that it is feasible to apply this method provided that its data requirements are met, such as a large enough set of reliable smallscale yield and irrigation time series data, especially soil data, to calibrate AquaCrop. The choice of a trigger index should not be underestimated because it proved to have a decisive influence on insurance premiums and indemnities. Our discussion of the contract conditions shows that hydrological drought insurance must comply with a series of constraints in order to avoid moral hazard and basis risk. © 2015 INIA.","AquaCrop; Crop insurance; Hydrological drought; Trigger index",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949202091

In a specific province covering areas that provide and receive water, simulation results for economic and environmental indicators at different levels of transferred water and pollution rates are obtained. Certain conclusions can be drawn from the findings. First, the SNWD Project can provide a sufficient quantity of water for economic growth in receiving regions. Second, an efficient quantity of transferred water exists, which demonstrates the growth limitation for both agriculture and the groundwater funnel. Third, upgrades in water quality can mutually reinforce the quantity effect and greatly promote economic growth. An environmental limitation exists for all economic activities.

The calculation of indicators from different domains and decomposition approaches is presented as part of post-processing of model results. We review user roles with regard to the application of complex economic models in agricultural IA, concluding that the GUIs will be mostly used by experienced analysts. The article stresses the role of GUIs in separating the code implementation of the economic model from the presentation of their results for analytical purposes. It highlights core functionalities of GUIs based on a detailed comparison between the GUIs and post-model analysis tools of three large economic models: Aglink- Cosimo, CAPRI and GTAP (Global Trade Analysis Project). Whereas the Aglink-Cosimo and CAPRI (Common Agricultural Policy Regionalised Impact Modelling System) models follow a strict separation between model and data analysis software tools, the GTAP model follows a model integrated approach using GEMPACK (General Equilibrium Modelling Package) tools. Moreover, the CAPRI GUI is technically and formally detached from the data generation process. Aglink-Cosimo and GTAP models use tools specifically developed to serve mainly their own needs (and tailored to communicate with their model drivers). One specific characteristic of Aglink-Cosimo relates to the need of interactive documentation for users due to the declarative nature of the code, which relies upon the obligation of the OECD and FAO to deliver a transparent and well-documented model and database to a formalized group of users.

With the socioeconomic development, research on water resources has become more important than before. In this study, we define ""water productivity"" as the changes of economic production outputs of sectoral activities in every cubic meter of water input, which is also the technical coefficient of water resource use in each sector. According to Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) framework, based on the Input-Output Table 2007 and water resources bulletin of Gansu Province, we introduced the water into the ORANI-G (A Generic Single-Country Computable General Equilibrium model) model through the nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function to analyze the changes of economic productions caused by water supply changes. We then examined water productivity in different sectors. Empirical results showed that current water productivity is underestimated. Agricultural water productivity is lower than that of the secondary and tertiary industries, even although agricultural water use is the largest part of water use in Gansu Province, and therefore improving agricultural water productivity can greatly mitigate the water shortage. Simulation results indicate that industrial transformation and development of water-saving industries will also mitigate water scarcity. Moreover, sensitivity analysis shows that the empirical results are robust under different scenarios. The results also show that higher constant elasticity of substitution rate (CES) between water and other production factors will contribute to sustainable development. © 2015.","Computable General Equilibrium model; Gansu Province; Sustainable development; Water productivity","Agriculture; Economic analysis; Economics; Elasticity; Planning; Productivity; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water supply; Computable general equilibrium; Computable general equilibrium model; Economic value of water; Elasticity of substitution; Gansu province; Industrial transformations; Socio-economic development; Water productivity; Water resources; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic analysis; sustainable development; water economics; water management; water resource; water supply; water use; China; Gansu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931004827

The adopted methodology was a community-based field survey followed by a hydrological modeling to estimate present and future flood damages for households and agriculture. Flood disaster occurred in 2007 was simulated and discussed. High-resolution atmospheric general circulation model’s precipitation outputs for emission scenario A1B were utilized with their bias corrections to obtain the precipitation patterns over lower WRR basin for Present (1979–2003) and Future (2075–2099) periods. A conceptual hydrologic model was employed to obtain the time series of daily river runoffs for the above-mentioned time durations followed by frequency analyses for probable flood discharges of 25- and 50-year return periods. Flood inundation simulations of 50-year return period events for Present and Future were carried out with the rainfall–runoff–inundation model followed by a flood damage assessment for household and agriculture based on the inundation simulation results, and field survey data over the target area and potential flood damages were discussed. Integration of hydrological modeling and socioeconomic approach to foresee potential flood damages was achieved, and the adopted damage assessment methodology was systematically explained. The total increments of household and agriculture damages due to climate change were estimated for Present as 1.80 and 1.95, and for Future, it was 2.40 and 2.27, respectively, compared to 2007 flood disaster. Future flood frequencies, intensities, and consequent damages in the area show a significant increment compared to the present situation despite limitations and uncertainties. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Climate change; Flood damage assessment; Flood hazards; Inundation modeling; MRI-AGCM precipitation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84914812178

Among various causes of disease spread, airborne dispersion has previously been considered to be an important factor that could not be controlled by preventive measures to stop the spread of disease that focus on direct and indirect contact. Forecasting and predicting airborne virus spread are important to make time for developing strategies and to minimise the damage of the disease. To predict the airborne spread of the disease a modelling approach is important since field experiments using sensors are ineffective because of the rarefied concentrations of virus in the air. The simulation of airborne spread during past outbreaks required improvement both for farmers and for policy decision makers. In this study a free license computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code was used to simulate airborne virus spread. Forecasting data from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) was directly connected in the developed model for real-time forecasting for 48h in three-hourly intervals. To reduce computation time, scalar transport for airborne virus spread was simulated based on a database for the CFD computed airflow in the investigated area using representative wind conditions. The simulation results, and the weather data were then used to make a database for a web-based forecasting system that could be accessible to users. © 2014 IAgrE.","Aerosol; Computational fluid dynamics; Foot-and-mouth disease; GIS; OpenFOAM","Aerosols; Agriculture; Decision making; Diseases; Epidemiology; Geographic information systems; Pathology; Viruses; Weather forecasting; Websites; Computational Fluid Dynamics codes; Developing strategy; Foot and mouth disease; Forecasting system; Infectious disease; OpenFOAM; Preventive measures; Real-time forecasting; Computational fluid dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909606615

Conflicts could arise among different decision-makers and stakeholders. Moreover, different policies can interact each other hampering or facilitating their implementation and effectiveness. This contribution describes a new implementation of GeSAP, an integrated modelling tool for enabling local GW management by combining the need for GW protection with socio-economic and behavioural determinants of GW use. GeSAP is based on the involvement of multiple stakeholders and the use of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) to simulate and explore their attitude relative to GW exploitation and their responses to the introduction of new protection and agricultural policies. In this work, GeSAP was implemented in the area of the Capitanata Irrigation Users Organization, located in the Apulia region (southern Italy). It was used to simulate the reactions of the main stakeholders involved in GW protection policy implementation and to assess the policy's effectiveness in terms of actual reduction of GW exploitation. Furthermore, the interactions between the GW protection policy and the coming reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was investigated. The results of the application proved the capability of the GeSAP tool to assess the actual effectiveness of GW protection policy by investigating how far this policy could be considered acceptable by farmers. In addition, this study demonstrates how the effectiveness of the GW protection policy could be affected by the interaction with the CAP reform. The latter could strongly impact the balance between water demand and availability with the effect of nullifying the positive synergy between CAP and GW protection policy. Although water management issues are not explicitly mentioned among the main scopes of the CAP, this work clearly demonstrates the impact that such policy could have on farmers' decisions on water use. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian belief network; CAP reform; Conflict assessment; Groundwater protection policy; Policies interaction","Agricultural policies; CAP reform; Conflict assessment; Ground water protection; Bayesian networks; agricultural policy; Bayesian analysis; groundwater resource; numerical model; simulation; stakeholder; water management; Foggia; Italy; Puglia; Puglia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908215307

CO2FIX Model Ver.3.2 was used to examine the dynamics of carbon stocks (C stocks) in a rubber plantation in South Western China with the changing rotation lengths. To estimate the efficiency of increasing the rotation length as an Article 3.4 activity, study predicted that the rubber production and C stocks of the ecosystem increased with the increasing rotation (25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 years). While comparing the pace of growth both in economical (rubber production) and ecological (C stocks) terms in each rotation, 40 years rotation length showed maximum production and C stocks. After elongation of 40 year rotation to four consecutive cycles, it was concluded that the total C stocks of the ecosystem were 186.65 Mg ha-1. The longer rotation lengths showed comparatively increased C stocks in below ground C stock after consecutive four rotations. The pace of C input (Mg C ha-1yr-1) and rubber production indicated that 40years rotation is best suited for rubber plantation. The study has developed carbon mitigation based on four rotation scenarios. The possible stimulated increase in C stocks of the entire ecosystem after consecutive long rotations indicated that the emphasis must be paid on deciding the rotation of rubber plantation in SW China for reporting under article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol. © 2014 Nizami et al.",,"organic matter; carbon; carbon dioxide; soil; Article; biomass; carbon sink; China; CO2FIX model; controlled study; ecology; economics; ecosystem; forest management; Hevea brasiliensis; plantation; rotation length; simulation; soil; agriculture; carbon sequestration; chemistry; computer simulation; growth, development and aging; Hevea; income; metabolism; regression analysis; Hevea; Agriculture; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; China; Computer Simulation; Ecosystem; Hevea; Income; Regression Analysis; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919800881

In principle, globalisation can maximise productivity and efficiency if competition prompts specialisation on the basis of productive capacity. In reality, however, such specialisation is often constrained by practical or political barriers, including those intended to ensure national or regional food security. These are likely to produce globally sub-optimal distributions of land uses. Both outcomes are subject to the responses of individual land managers to economic and environmental stimuli, and these responses are known to be variable and often (economically) irrational. We investigate the consequences of stylised food security policies and globalisation of agricultural markets on land use patterns under a variety of modelled forms of land manager behaviour, including variation in production levels, tenacity, land use intensity and multi-functionality. We find that a system entirely dedicated to regional food security is inferior to an entirely globalised system in terms of overall production levels, but that several forms of behaviour limit the difference between the two, and that variations in land use intensity and functionality can substantially increase the provision of food and other ecosystem services in both cases. We also find emergent behaviour that results in the abandonment of productive land, the slowing of rates of land use change and the fragmentation or, conversely, concentration of land uses following changes in demand levels. © 2014 Brown et al.",,"agriculture; Article; controlled study; food industry; food security; international relations; land use; policy; simulation; catering service; decision making; environment; human; international cooperation; procedures; Agriculture; Decision Making; Environment; Food Supply; Humans; Internationality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84914674673

This causes conflicts of interests among various water actors with mostly contradicting objectives and uncertainties about the consequences of potential management interventions. The objective of this paper is to present a methodological framework to support decision making under uncertainties for the management of complex hydrosystems. The proposed framework conceptualises hydrological and socio-economic interactions by constructing a Bayesian network (BN)-based decision support tool for a typical management problem of agricultural coastal regions. Thereby, the paper demonstrates the value of combining two different commonly used integrated modelling approaches. Coupled domain models are applied to simulate the nonlinearities and feedbacks of a strongly interacting groundwater–agriculture hydrosystem. Afterwards, a BN is used to integrate their results together with empirical knowledge and expert opinions regarding potential management interventions. A prototype application is performed for a coastal arid region, which is affected by saltwater intrusion into a coastal aquifer due to excessive groundwater extraction for irrigated agriculture. It addresses the issues of contradicting management objectives such as sustainable aquifer management vs. profitable agricultural production and the problem of finding appropriate management interventions or policies. Several policy combinations have been analysed regarding their efficiency within different management scenarios in a probabilistic way, which enables decision makers to assess the risks associated with implementing alternative management strategies. In addition, efficient metrics for evaluating performance and uncertainty of the developed task-specific BN are used which underline the reliability of the results. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Agriculture; Bayesian network; Decision support tool; Groundwater; Integrated management; Simulation–optimisation","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Aquifers; Bayesian networks; Complex networks; Environmental protection; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Salt water intrusion; Agricultural productions; Decision making under uncertainty; Decision support tools; Integrated management; Integrated modelling approach; Management interventions; Methodological frameworks; Optimisations; Decision support systems; agricultural development; arid region; Bayesian analysis; coastal zone; decision making; integrated approach; saline intrusion; socioeconomic conditions; sustainable development; uncertainty analysis; water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912123233

Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709, United States","United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) researchers are developing a strategy for high-throughput (HT) exposure-based prioritization of chemicals under the ExpoCast program. These novel modeling approaches for evaluating chemicals based on their potential for biologically relevant human exposures will inform toxicity testing and prioritization for chemical risk assessment. Based on probabilistic methods and algorithms developed for The Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation Model for Multimedia, Multipathway Chemicals (SHEDS-MM), a new mechanistic modeling approach has been developed to accommodate high-throughput (HT) assessment of exposure potential. In this SHEDS-HT model, the residential and dietary modules of SHEDS-MM have been operationally modified to reduce the user burden, input data demands, and run times of the higher-tier model, while maintaining critical features and inputs that influence exposure. The model has been implemented in R; the modeling framework links chemicals to consumer product categories or food groups (and thus exposure scenarios) to predict HT exposures and intake doses. Initially, SHEDS-HT has been applied to 2507 organic chemicals associated with consumer products and agricultural pesticides. These evaluations employ data from recent USEPA efforts to characterize usage (prevalence, frequency, and magnitude), chemical composition, and exposure scenarios for a wide range of consumer products. In modeling indirect exposures from near-field sources, SHEDS-HT employs a fugacity-based module to estimate concentrations in indoor environmental media. The concentration estimates, along with relevant exposure factors and human activity data, are then used by the model to rapidly generate probabilistic population distributions of near-field indirect exposures via dermal, nondietary ingestion, and inhalation pathways. Pathway-specific estimates of near-field direct exposures from consumer products are also modeled. Population dietary exposures for a variety of chemicals found in foods are combined with the corresponding chemical-specific near-field exposure predictions to produce aggregate population exposure estimates. The estimated intake dose rates (mg/kg/day) for the 2507 chemical case-study spanned 13 orders of magnitude. SHEDS-HT successfully reproduced the pathway-specific exposure results of the higher-tier SHEDS-MM for a case-study pesticide and produced median intake doses significantly correlated (p &lt; 0.0001, R2 = 0.39) with medians inferred using biomonitoring data for 39 chemicals from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Based on the favorable performance of SHEDS-HT with respect to these initial evaluations, we believe this new tool will be useful for HT prediction of chemical exposure potential. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemical contamination; Computer simulation; Consumer products; Environmental Protection Agency; Indicators (chemical); Industrial chemicals; Pesticides; Population statistics; Probability distributions; Risk assessment; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Throughput; Agricultural pesticides; Chemical compositions; Chemical risk assessment; Environmental media; Mechanistic modeling; Orders of magnitude; Probabilistic methods; United states environmental protection agencies; Organic chemicals; organic compound; pesticide; biological marker; organic compound; pesticide; pollutant; algorithm; biomonitoring; concentration (composition); data set; food intake; health risk; integrated approach; numerical model; pesticide; population distribution; prioritization; risk assessment; agriculture; algorithm; Article; biological monitoring; chemical composition; consumer; controlled study; correlation analysis; decomposition; diet; dietary intake; environmental exposure; food; health survey; high throughput screening; human; human experiment; ingestion; inhalation; Monte Carlo method; population distribution; population exposure; prediction; probability; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; simulation; statistical model; stochastic model; The Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation Model for Multimedia, Multipathway Chemicals; uncertainty; analysis; computer simulation; environmental exposure; multimedia; nutrition; pollutant; statistical model; statistics; statistics and numerical data; United States; Biomarkers; Computer Simulation; Diet; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Models, Statistical; Multimedia; Nutrition Surveys; Organic Chemicals; Pesticides; Stochastic Processes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908587564

In our view, mathematical modeling will be required to provide scientific guidance to meet this challenge. In order to be useful in GHG mitigation policy measures, models must simultaneously meet scientific, software engineering, and human capacity requirements. They can be used to understand GHG fluxes, to evaluate proposed GHG mitigation actions, and to predict and monitor the effects of specific actions; the latter applications require a change in mindset that has parallels with the shift from research modeling to decision support. We compare and contrast 6 agro-ecosystem models (FullCAM, DayCent, DNDC, APSIM, WNMM, and AgMod), chosen because they are used in Australian agriculture and forestry. Underlying structural similarities in the representations of carbon flows though plants and soils in these models are complemented by a diverse range of emphases and approaches to the subprocesses within the agro-ecosystem. None of these agro-ecosystem models handles all land sector GHG fluxes, and considerable model-based uncertainty exists for soil C fluxes and enteric methane emissions. The models also show diverse approaches to the initialisation of model simulations, software implementation, distribution, licensing, and software quality assurance; each of these will differentially affect their usefulness for policy-driven GHG mitigation prediction and monitoring. Specific requirements imposed on the use of models by Australian mitigation policy settings are discussed, and areas for further scientific development of agro-ecosystem models for use in GHG mitigation policy are proposed. © 2014 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization.",,"Carbon; Computer software selection and evaluation; Decision support systems; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Gas emissions; Quality assurance; Software engineering; Australian agricultures; Capacity requirement; Enteric methane emissions; Greenhouse gas balance; Scientific development; Software implementation; Software quality assurance; Structural similarity; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911478054

However, when data are required at European level, important margins of uncertainty still exist due to the representativeness of local data at large scale or different assumptions and information utilized for running models. In this context, a pan-European (EU + Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Norway) simulation platform with high spatial resolution and harmonized data sets was developed to provide consistent scenarios in support of possible carbon sequestration policies. Using the CENTURY agroecosystem model, six alternative management practices (AMP) scenarios were assessed as alternatives to the business as usual situation (BAU). These consisted of the conversion of arable land to grassland (and vice versa), straw incorporation, reduced tillage, straw incorporation combined with reduced tillage, ley cropping system and cover crops. The conversion into grassland showed the highest soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rates, ranging between 0.4 and 0.8 t C ha-1 yr-1, while the opposite extreme scenario (100% of grassland conversion into arable) gave cumulated losses of up to 2 Gt of C by 2100. Among the other practices, ley cropping systems and cover crops gave better performances than straw incorporation and reduced tillage. The allocation of 12 to 28% of the European arable land to different AMP combinations resulted in a potential SOC sequestration of 101-336 Mt CO2 eq. by 2020 and 549-2141 Mt CO2 eq. by 2100. Modelled carbon sequestration rates compared with values from an ad hoc meta-analysis confirmed the robustness of these estimates. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Agricultural management; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Europe; GHGs mitigation; Land-use change; Modelling","soil; agriculture; carbon sequestration; chemistry; environmental protection; Europe; procedures; soil; theoretical model; Agriculture; Carbon Sequestration; Conservation of Natural Resources; Europe; Models, Theoretical; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907867219

They are useful for studying such systems because of their ability to incorporate micro-level behaviors among interacting agents, and to understand emergent phenomena due to these interactions. However, ABMs are inherently stochastic and require proper handling of uncertainty. We propose a simulation framework based on quantitative uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to build parsimonious ABMs that serve two purposes: exploration of the outcome space to simulate low-probability but high-consequence events that may have significant policy implications, and explanation of model behavior to describe the system with higher accuracy. The proposed framework is applied to the problem of modeling farmland conservation resulting in land use change. We employ output variance decomposition based on quasi-random sampling of the input space and perform three computational experiments. First, we perform uncertainty analysis to improve model legitimacy, where the distribution of results informs us about the expected value that can be validated against independent data, and provides information on the variance around this mean as well as the extreme results. In our last two computational experiments, we employ sensitivity analysis to produce two simpler versions of the ABM. First, input space is reduced only to inputs that produced the variance of the initial ABM, resulting in a model with output distribution similar to the initial model. Second, we refine the value of the most influential input, producing a model that maintains the mean of the output of initial ABM but with less spread. These simplifications can be used to 1) efficiently explore model outcomes, including outliers that may be important considerations in the design of robust policies, and 2) conduct explanatory analysis that exposes the smallest number of inputs influencing the steady state of the modeled system. © 2014 Ligmann-Zielinska et al.",,"agent based model; agricultural land; Article; environmental protection; land use; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty; agriculture; biological model; computer simulation; ecosystem; environmental planning; environmental protection; geography; probability; soil; United States; soil; Agriculture; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Policy; Geography; Michigan; Models, Biological; Probability; Soil; Uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908425542

The main objective of this study is to evaluate the infrastructure sufficiency in meeting water demand under climate-induced socio-hydrological transition in the Capibaribe River basin (CRB). The basin has experienced spatial and sectoral (agriculture-to-urban) reconfiguration of water demands. Human settlements that were once dispersed, relying on intermittent sources of surface water, are now larger and more spatially concentrated, which increases water-scarcity effects. Based on the application of linked hydrologic and water-resources models using precipitation and temperature projections of the IPCC SRES (Special Report: Emissions Scenarios) A1B scenario, a reduction in rainfall of 26.0% translated to streamflow reduction of 60.0%. We used simulations from four members of the HadCM3 (UK Met Office Hadley Centre) perturbed physics ensemble, in which a single model structure is used and perturbations are introduced to the physical parameterization schemes in the model (Chou et al., 2012). We considered that the change of the water availability in the basin in the future scenarios must drive the water management and the development of adaptation strategies that will manage the water demand. Several adaptive responses are considered, including water-loss reductions, wastewater collection and reuse, and rainwater collection cisterns, which together have potential to reduce future water demand by 23.0%. This study demonstrates the vulnerabilities of the infrastructure system during socio-hydrological transition in response to hydroclimatic and demand variabilities in the CRB and also indicates the differential spatial impacts and vulnerability of multiple uses of water to changes over time. The simulations showed that the measures proposed and the water from interbasin transfer project of the São Francisco River had a positive impact over the water supply in the basin, mainly for human use. Industry and irrigation will suffer impact unless other measures are implemented for demand control.",,"Climate change; Computer simulation; Precipitation (meteorology); River basin projects; Rivers; Wastewater reclamation; Water management; Water supply; Watersheds; Adaptation strategies; Emissions scenarios; Infrastructure systems; Physical parameterization; Rainwater collections; Temperature projection; Wastewater collection; Water availability; Water conservation; infrastructure; irrigation; parameterization; precipitation intensity; rainfall; river; streamflow; surface water; water availability; water demand; water management; Brazil; Capibaribe Estuary; Pernambuco; Sao Francisco Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949116856

Livestock accounts for 40% of worldwide income from agriculture. Demand for animal products is set to continue increasing in the next three decades, as is their market price. If not carefully managed, a worldwide increase in the production of animal-derived products would increase pressure on natural resources (particularly water and land), significantly raising levels of dangerous greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the risk of people contracting zoonotic diseases. These realities are informing governments as they encourage the managed intensification of livestock production. They seek to do this in ways that take account of poorer people's contributions to the growth of rural economies. They look for ways to link together work on agricultural productivity, efficient food systems; infrastructure development; access to energy, water and affordable health care; and the sustenance of environmental services (including the mitigation of any further stimuli for changes in the global climate). Managed intensification of livestock production would also require long-term application of a One Health approach with its focus on mitigating health risks at the interfaces between animals and humans in different ecosystems. It will stimulate the joint working of multiple interests in pursuit of a common goal - ending hunger and malnutrition. The authors would like to see the One Health approach being incorporated within all nations' animal, environmental and public health policies and into the educational agendas of medical and veterinary undergraduate students. It must also be incorporated into preparedness, contingency planning, desk-top exercises and on-site simulations to get ready for the next mega disaster - no matter how improbable it might seem.","Food security; Livestock; Nutrition; One Health; Zoonotic disease","agriculture; animal; animal disease; catering service; developed country; developing country; economics; health; human; livestock; organization and management; policy; procedures; public health; time; wild animal; zoonosis; Agriculture; Animal Diseases; Animals; Animals, Wild; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Food Supply; Global Health; Humans; Livestock; Public Health; Public Policy; Time Factors; Zoonoses",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908133929

Most European member states opted for a mandatory vaccination campaign, whereas the Netherlands, amongst others, opted for a voluntary campaign. For the latter to be effective, the farmer's willingness to vaccinate should be high enough to reach satisfactory vaccination coverage to stop the spread of the disease. This study looked at a farmer's expected utility of vaccination, which is expected to have a positive impact on the willingness to vaccinate.Decision analysis was used to structure the vaccination decision problem into decisions, events and payoffs, and to define the relationships among these elements. Two scenarios were formulated to distinguish farmers' mindsets, based on differences in dairy heifer management. For each of the scenarios, a decision tree was run for two years to study vaccination behaviour over time. The analysis was done based on the expected utility criterion. This allows to account for the effect of a farmer's risk preference on the vaccination decision. Probabilities were estimated by experts, payoffs were based on an earlier published study.According to the results of the simulation, the farmer decided initially to vaccinate against BTV-8 as the net expected utility of vaccination was positive. Re-vaccination was uncertain due to less expected costs of a continued outbreak. A risk averse farmer in this respect is more likely to re-vaccinate. When heifers were retained for export on the farm, the net expected utility of vaccination was found to be generally larger and thus was re-vaccination more likely to happen.For future animal health programmes that rely on a voluntary approach, results show that the provision of financial incentives can be adjusted to the farmers' willingness to vaccinate over time. Important in this respect are the decision moment and the characteristics of the disease. Farmers' perceptions of the disease risk and about the efficacy of available control options cannot be neglected. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Bluetongue; Decision-making; Emergent disease; Risk aversion; Risk perception; Voluntary vaccination","Animalia; Bluetongue virus; Bluetongue virus 8; virus vaccine; agriculture; animal; bluetongue; Bluetongue orbivirus; bovine; Cattle Diseases; computer simulation; decision support system; economics; Epidemics; female; genetics; Netherlands; physiology; serotype; vaccination; veterinary; virology; Bovinae; Agriculture; Animals; Bluetongue; Bluetongue virus; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Computer Simulation; Decision Support Techniques; Epidemics; Female; Netherlands; Serogroup; Vaccination; Viral Vaccines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901846319

Life cycle assessment (LCA) of GHG emissions from U.S. grain-fed beef cattle was conducted based on industry statistics and previous studies to identify the main sources of uncertainty in these estimations. Uncertainty associated with GHG emissions from indirect land use change, pasture soil emissions (e.g. soil carbon sequestration), enteric fermentation from cattle on pasture, and methane emissions from feedlot manure, respectively, contributed the most variability to life cycle GHG emissions from beef production. Feeding of coproducts from ethanol production was estimated to reduce life cycle emissions by 1.7%, but could increase emissions by 0.6-2.0% with higher feeding rates. Monte Carlo simulation found a range of life cycle emissions from 2.52 to 9.58 kg CO2 per kg live weight (5th and 95th percentiles), with a calculated average of 8.14, which is between recent estimates. Current methods used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) associated with beef production in feedlots were found to account for only 3-20% of life cycle GHG emissions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To enable this, quantitative decision support tools are required at two levels of analysis: (1) single-hazard surveillance system and (2) surveillance portfolio. This paper addresses the first level by presenting a conceptual approach for the economic analysis of single-hazard surveillance systems. The concept includes objective and subjective aspects of single-hazard surveillance system analysis: (1) a simulation part to derive an efficient set of surveillance setups based on the technical surveillance performance parameters (TSPPs) and the corresponding surveillance costs, i.e., objective analysis, and (2) a multi-criteria decision making model to evaluate the impacts of the hazard surveillance, i.e., subjective analysis. The conceptual approach was checked for (1) conceptual validity and (2) data validity. Issues regarding the practical use of the approach, particularly the data requirement, were discussed. We concluded that the conceptual approach is scientifically credible for economic analysis of single-hazard surveillance systems and that the practicability of the approach depends on data availability. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Conceptual framework; Economic analysis; Livestock hazard surveillance","agriculture; animal; Animal Diseases; economics; health survey; livestock; physiology; risk assessment; statistical model; veterinary medicine; Agriculture; Animal Diseases; Animals; Livestock; Models, Economic; Population Surveillance; Risk Assessment; Veterinary Medicine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897957486

We use an economic model of global land use to investigate, from 2010 to 2030, the global agricultural outcomes, land use changes, and GHG abatement resulting from two potential Brazilian policies: a tax on cattle from conventional pasture and a subsidy for cattle from semiintensive pasture. We find that under either policy, Brazil could achieve considerable sparing of forests and abatement of GHGs, in line with its national policy targets. The land spared, particularly under the tax, is far less than proportional to the productivity increased. However, the tax, despite prompting less adoption of semi-intensive ranching, delivers slightly more forest sparing and GHG abatement than the subsidy. This difference is explained by increased deforestation associated with increased beef consumption under the subsidy and reduced deforestation associated with reduced beef consumption under the tax. Complementary policies to directly limit deforestation could help limit these effects. GHG abatement from either the tax or subsidy appears inexpensive but, over time, the tax would become cheaper than the subsidy. A revenue-neutral combination of the policies could be an element of a sustainable development strategy for Brazil and other emerging economies seeking to balance agricultural development and forest protection.",,"agricultural land; agricultural procedures; article; beef; Brazil; carbon footprint; cattle; cattle ranching intensification; deforestation; economic aspect; food intake; land use; nonhuman; pasture; policy; priority journal; sustainable development; tax; agricultural intensification; climate policy; land sparing; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Brazil; Carbon; Carbon Footprint; Cattle; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forestry; Greenhouse Effect; Taxes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901022840

To facilitate policy decisions on mitigation and adaptation strategies, it is necessary to understand, quantify, and synthesize these climate-change impacts, taking into account their uncertainties. Crucial to these decisions is an understanding of how impacts in different sectors overlap, as overlapping impacts increase exposure, lead to interactions of impacts, and are likely to raise adaptation pressure. As a first step we develop herein a framework to study coinciding impacts and identify regional exposure hotspots. This framework can then be used as a starting point for regional case studies on vulnerability and multifaceted adaptation strategies. We consider impacts related to water, agriculture, ecosystems, and malaria at different levels of global warming. Multisectoral overlap starts to be seen robustly at a mean global warming of 3 °C above the 1980-2010 mean, with 11% of the world population subject to severe impacts in at least two of the four impact sectors at 4 °C. Despite these general conclusions, we find that uncertainty arising from the impact models is considerable, and larger than that from the climate models. In a low probability-high impact worst-case assessment, almost the whole inhabited world is at risk for multisectoral pressures. Hence, there is a pressing need for an increased research effort to develop a more comprehensive understanding of impacts, as well as for the development of policy measures under existing uncertainty.","Coinciding pressures; Differential climate impacts; ISI-MIP","agriculture; article; climate change; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; human; priority journal; water management; coinciding pressures; differential climate impacts; ISI-MIP; Agriculture; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environment; Geography; Global Warming; Humans; Malaria; Models, Theoretical; Public Policy; Temperature; Water Supply; coinciding pressures; differential climate impacts; ISI-MIP",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895808871

It contains a daily time step distributed parameter continuous simulation surface runoff model designed to assist with determining Best Management Practices (BMPs), the setting of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs), and for risk and cost/benefit analyses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the capabilities of the model to simulate runoff and sediment loads in a small Mediterranean agricultural watershed (207. ha) located in the region of Navarre (Spain) using nine years of continuous data monitoring. Data for the first five years (2003-2007) were used for calibration and the remaining four years (2008-2011) for validation. No significant channel erosion nor in-stream structures were identified within this small and homogeneous watershed. Thus the set of models for analysing stream networks and corridors were not considered in this study. Firstly, AnnAGNPS was calibrated for runoff by modifying Curve Number values for different stages of the main crops. Results showed that the model satisfactory simulated surface runoff at monthly, seasonal and annual scales both in calibration and in validation processes. A Differential Sensitivity Analysis (DSA) was carried out to evaluate the sensitivity of eight input parameters for sediment load prediction. Based on DSA results, the AnnAGNPS model was calibrated for sediment load simulation. The model was capable of simulating the sediment load at an annual scale with a difference of less than 1% for calibration and 7% for validation. However, the results at monthly and seasonal scale were less precise. The use of stream networks and corridors models, already inserted in the system of computer models that make up AnnAGNPS, seem to be necessary for a more precise explanation of sediment yields and loads at monthly and seasonal scales, even for small watersheds. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","AnnAGNPS calibration and validation; Mediterranean agriculture; Soil erosion; Watershed modelling","Agricultural non-point source pollutions; Best management practice (BMPs); Calibration and validations; Non-point source pollutants; Runoff and sediment yields; Soil erosion; Total maximum daily load; Watershed modelling; Agricultural runoff; Agriculture; Calibration; Computer hardware description languages; Computer simulation; Erosion; Forecasting; Monitoring; Water pollution; Watersheds; Sediments; agricultural catchment; best management practice; computer simulation; cost-benefit analysis; Mediterranean environment; model validation; prediction; runoff; sediment yield; soil erosion; stream channel; watershed; Navarra; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890746745

We present methodology, results, and experiences of a participation process in a regional soil water erosion vulnerability assessment in Austria. A peer group consisting of agricultural extension specialists, administration, and scientists identified the impacts of uncertain future precipitation on soil water erosion and the effectiveness of relevant soil conservation measures as the most crucial knowledge gap. We applied the bio-physical process model Environmental Policy Integrated Climate to simulate potential sediment yields using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation methodology and crop yields to calculate gross margins. The simulations have been performed for five climate change scenarios until 2040 and three alternative crop management practices. A heterogeneous expanded stakeholder group provided knowledge on regional crop production and management and thus contributed to a first validation of the model input data. Model results indicate an increase in severely erosion-prone cropland by 76 to 135% with higher precipitation sums for 2040, on average. Furthermore, reduced tillage and cultivating winter cover crops have been identified as effective adaptation measures reducing mean sediment loss between 7 and 31%, on average. A peer group validated model output with respect to relevance, plausibility, and usability of results and confirmed the usefulness of the results to inform the public debate on regional climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability in agriculture. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Agricultural vulnerability assessment; Climate change impacts; EPIC; RUSLE; Soil water erosion; Stakeholder participation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893664260

This paper implements a generalized agent-based model (ABM) as a virtual laboratory to explore how global and local processes influence the land-use and livelihood decisions of local land-users, operationalized as settlement-level agents, across the landscapes of six real-world test sites. Test sites were chosen in USA, Laos, and China to capture globally-significant variation in population density, market influence, and environmental conditions, with land systems ranging from swidden to commercial agriculture. Publicly available global data were integrated into the ABM to model cross-scale effects of economic globalization on local land-use decisions. A suite of statistics was developed to assess the accuracy of model-predicted land-use outcomes relative to observed and random (i.e. null model) landscapes. At four of six sites, where environmental and demographic forces were important constraints on land-use choices, modeled land-use outcomes were more similar to those observed across sites than the null model. At the two sites in which market forces significantly influenced land-use and livelihood decisions, the model was a poorer predictor of land-use outcomes than the null model. Model successes and failures in simulating real-world land-use patterns enabled the testing of hypotheses on land-use decision-making and yielded insights on the importance of missing mechanisms. The virtual laboratory approach provides a practical framework for systematic improvement of both theory and predictive skill in land change science based on a continual process of experimentation and model enhancement. © 2014 Magliocca et al.",,"accuracy; agriculture; article; China; decision making; economic aspect; environment; land use; landscape; Laos; outcome assessment; population density; simulation; United States; Agriculture; China; Commerce; Conservation of Natural Resources; Decision Making; Environment; Humans; Internationality; Laos; Models, Statistical; Population Density; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900434351

The model represents hydrology as well as water operations, which together influence water supplied for agricultural, urban, and environmental uses. The model is developed for impacts assessment using scenarios for climate change and other drivers of water system behavior. In this paper, we describe the model structure, its representation of historical streamflow, agricultural and urban water demands, and water operations. We describe projected impacts of climate change on hydrology and water supply to the major irrigation districts in the area, using uniform 2°C, 4°C, and 6°C increases applied to climate inputs from the calibration period. Consistent with other studies, we find that the timing of hydrology shifts earlier in the water year in response to temperature warming (5-21 days). The integrated agricultural model responds with increased water demands 2°C (1.4-2.0%), 4°C (2.8-3.9%), and 6°C (4.2-5.8%). In this sensitivity analysis, the combination of altered hydrology and increased demands results in decreased reliability of surface water supplied for agricultural purposes, with modeled quantity-based reliability metrics decreasing from a range of 0.84-0.90 under historical conditions to 0.75-0.79 under 6°C warming scenario. © 2014 Kiparsky et al.",,"surface water; water; article; climate change; controlled study; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; environmental temperature; greenhouse effect; hydrology; irrigation (agriculture); process model; river basin; sensitivity analysis; United States; urban area; water supply; watershed; river; water flow; California; Climate Change; Rivers; Water Movements; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922235494

Research on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses from farmland and the factors that influence these losses is very meaningful both for increasing the crop yield and for improving environmental water quality. To explore the mechanism by which N and P are lost from farmland in the North China Plain (NCP), 16 simulated rainfalls were conducted in 14 experimental fields (each of which had different conditions) in the NCP from July to August in 2010. The results showed that the rainfall intensity, the antecedent soil moisture content, and the vegetation cover status were the main factors that affected the surface runoff in the NCP. The runoff volume increased with the increasing rainfall intensity and the increasing soil moisture content, and decreased with the increasing vegetation cover. These factors also significantly affected the losses of P and N. The losses of P and N were positively correlated with the rainfall intensity and the antecedent soil moisture content, and negatively correlated with the vegetation cover. A longer and more intense rainfall resulted in a higher loss of N and P. Dissolved nitrogen was the predominant form of N loss. For phosphorous, the predominant loss form was greatly influenced by the rainfall intensity, the vegetation cover, and the antecedent soil moisture content. Most of phosphorus existed as dissolved phosphorus in Baizhuang (BZ) and as particulate phosphorus in Tangcheng (TC) and Fentai (FT). The minimum requirements for runoff occurrence in experimental regions were a rainfall depth of 5.1. mm, a rainfall intensity of 50. mm/h, and an antecedent soil moisture of approximately 29.6%. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Loss mechanism; Non-point source pollution; Plain farmland; Rainfall simulation; Soil nutrients","Farms; Moisture determination; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Runoff; Soil moisture; Vegetation; Water pollution; Water quality; Loss mechanisms; Non-point source pollution; Plain farmland; Rainfall simulations; Soil nutrients; Rain; nitrogen; phosphorus; rain; runoff; agricultural land; moisture content; nonpoint source pollution; nutrient loss; particulate matter; phosphorus; precipitation intensity; runoff; soil moisture; vegetation cover; water quality; agricultural land; article; China; dissolution; geographic distribution; nonpoint source pollution; nutrient concentration; particulate matter; priority journal; simulation; soil moisture; vegetation; water flow; water quality; China; North China Plain; Loss mechanism; Non-point source pollution; Plain farmland; Rainfall simulation; Soil nutrients; Agriculture; China; Crops, Agricultural; Molybdenum; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Rain; Soil; Spectrophotometry; Water Movements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885038875

Nineteen smaller catchments contribute the remaining water mainly from annual precipitation. The latter will gain importance if glaciers retreat as predicted. Hydrological models can visualize such climate change impacts on water resources. However, poor data availability often hampers simulating the contributions of smaller catchments. We tested several data pre-processing methods (gap filling, MODAWEC (MOnthly to DAily WEather Converter), lapse rate) and their effect on the performance of the HBV (Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenavdelning)-light model. Monte Carlo simulations were used to define parameter uncertainties and ensembles of behavioral model runs. Model performances were evaluated by constrained measures of goodness-of-fit criteria (cumulative bias, coefficient of determination, model efficiency coefficients (NSE) for high flow and log-transformed flow). The developed data pre-processing arrangement can utilize data of relatively poor quality (only monthly means or daily data with gaps) but still provide model results with NSE between 0.50 and 0.88. Some of these may not be accurate enough to directly guide water management applications. However, the pre-processing supports producing key information that may initiate rigging of monitoring facilities, and enable water management to respond to fundamentally changing water availability. © 2014 by the authors.","Carlo simulation; HBV-light model; Hydrological modeling; Lapse rate; MODAWEC; Monte; Multiple linear regression","Catchments; Climate change; Climate models; Data handling; Hydrology; Intelligent systems; Linear regression; Monte Carlo methods; Processing; Runoff; Water management; Carlo simulation; Hydrological modeling; Lapse rate; Light modeling; MODAWEC; Monte; Multiple linear regressions; Water resources; catchment; hydrological modeling; irrigation system; Monte Carlo analysis; snowmelt; water availability; water management; water resource; Ferghana Valley; Hepatitis B virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920915030

The utility maximization problemis one formof a covering problemwheremultiple criteria can represent the expected social benefits of conservation action. This approach allows flexibility with a problem formulation that is more general than typical reserve design problems, though the solution methods are very similar. However, few studies have addressed optimization in utility maximization problems for conservation planning, and the effect of solution procedure is largely unquantified. Therefore, this study mapped five criteria describing elements of multifunctional agriculture to determine a hypothetical conservation resource allocation plan for agricultural land conservation in the Central Valley of CA, USA. We compared solution procedures within the utility maximization framework to determine the difference between an open source integer programming approach and a greedy heuristic, and find gains from optimization of up to 12%.We also model land availability for conservation action as a stochastic process and determine the decline in total utility compared to the globally optimal set using both solution algorithms. Our results are comparable to other studies illustrating the benefits of optimization for different conservation planning problems, and highlight the importance of maximizing the effectiveness of limited funding for conservation and natural resource management. © 2014 Kreitler et al.","California; Central valley; Conservation planning; Farmland conservation; Multifunctional agriculture; Spatial conservation prioritization; Utility maximization","agricultural land; algorithm; Article; biodiversity; budget; climate; computer simulation; conservation biology; cost utility analysis; culture optimization; environmental protection; flooding; integer programming; land use; real estate; soil quality; spatial soil variability; statistical analysis; stochastic model; urban area; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84916918775

The present study investigated whether an effective water resources management strategy, capable of minimizing evaporative water losses and groundwater depletion while providing water for expanded agricultural activities, can be achieved through aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) implemented in conjunction with water storage in an ephemeral river. A regional development modeling framework, including both ASR and a dam design developed through system dynamics modeling, was validated using a case study for the Sirik region of Iran. The system dynamics model of groundwater flow and the comprehensive system dynamics model developed in this study showed that ASR was a beneficial strategy for the region's farmers and the groundwater system, since the rate of groundwater depletion declined significantly (from 14.5 meters per 40 years to three meters over the same period). Furthermore, evaporation from the reservoir decreased by 50 million cubic meters over the simulation period. It was concluded that the proposed system dynamics model is an effective tool in helping to conserve water resources and reduce depletion in arid regions and semi-arid areas. © by the authors.","Aquifer storage and recovery; Arid; Dam; Groundwater; Semi-arid; System dynamics modeling","Agriculture; Aquifers; Arid regions; Dams; Design; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Recovery; Regional planning; Reservoirs (water); System theory; Agricultural activities; Aquifer storage and recovery; Arid; Arid and semi-arid areas; Groundwater depletion; Semi arid; System dynamics model; Water resources management; Groundwater resources; aquifer; arid region; evaporation; flow modeling; groundwater abstraction; groundwater resource; management practice; resource depletion; semiarid region; water management; water resource; water storage; Hormozgan; Iran; Sirik",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906216211

Our study used three different chemical transport models (CHIMERE, EMEP and LOTOS-EUROS) to quantify the reductions of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations due to reductions of NH3 emissions beyond the Gothenburg Protocol (GP), as well as due to the GP alone compared to 2009. Simulations of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations using 2009 meteorology were undertaken for five emission scenarios: 2009 emissions (as the reference simulation), GP emissions in 2020, and further 10%, 20% and 30% NH3 emission reductions in EU27 beyond the GP. The modelling results for the scenarios with further 10%, 20% and 30% NH3 agriculture emission reductions in EU27 beyond the GP show that the reduction achieved in PM concentrations is not linear with the emission reductions. In fact, the results from the study show that the impact of ammonia emissions reduction is significantly more efficient when the emission reduction rises. Moreover, based on the evaluation on 2009, the modelling study shows that the expected impact of ammonia emissions on the formation of particulate ammonium was underestimated by all models. This would imply that the role of ammonia on PM concentration and exceedances of PM2.5 and PM10 limit values is likely to be even larger than quantified in this study. This study shows that the implementation of the emission reductions imposed by the revised GP for 2020 will not suffice to achieve compliance with PM limit values everywhere in Europe; hence further European and local measures may be considered. NH3 emissions from agriculture can be further reduced with the implementation of proven and feasible measures (substitution of fertilizers, improved storage of manure, way fertilizer injections, etc., . . .), in order to reduce PM concentrations and their impacts on human health across Europe. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Ammonia; Chemistry transport model; Emission scenarios; Gothenburg Protocol","ammonia; fertilizer; agriculture; air quality; article; chemical parameters; concentration (parameters); evaluation study; geographic distribution; human; manure; meteorology; particulate matter; priority journal; reduction kinetics; storage; Article; Europe; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906083626

At the local level, Commissariats Régionaux de Développement Agricole [Regional Agricultural Development Committees (CRDAs)], which represented the government bodies, managed water resources. The Tunisian Government then decided to involve farmers in the local management of water resources by creating Agricultural Development Associations (GDAs). Water resource management by CRDAs must now take into account water demand from farmers belonging to GDAs and, in return, farmers must acknowledge water scarcity and accept the need for resource-sharing. How can CRDAs and GDAs work towards cooperative water management? In this paper, we present a simulation game requested by officials at the Kairouan CRDA in order to develop cooperative management of the water resources in a typical small watershed in central Tunisia. Our aim was to use the game to increase both farmers' awareness of water resource-sharing, scarcity, and the impact of overexploitation, and CRDA officials' awareness of different uses that determine water demands. The game is based on a hydrological model of the watershed and an agro-economic model of farming systems that use water resources for irrigation.

We develop dynamic economywide models for Ethiopia and Uganda that capture both traditional aspects of the debate (growth linkages and foreign trade) and benefits from urbanization (internal migration and agglomeration effects). Simulations suggest that urban agglomeration is an important source of long-term growth and structural transformation, but that investing in cities does not greatly reduce national poverty over the short-term. In this regard, agricultural growth is more effective, albeit with slower national growth. Given these trade-offs, we conclude that, while urbanization's benefits argue against an ""agro-fundamentalist"" approach to African development, the short-term imperative of reducing poverty necessitates further agricultural investment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Africa; Economic growth; Poverty; Structural transformation; Urban agglomeration","agglomeration; agriculture; economic development; economic growth; poverty; structural change; urbanization; Ethiopia; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905060019

The other determinants of sprawl include high population growth on account of migration and the establishment of growing network of public utilities. Unlike plains the vertical expansion of cities in these areas is constrained due to geo-structural sensitivity of the region, the cities in such areas mainly grow outwards along their peripheries and major transport corridors encroaching into productive agricultural land, wetlands and forest areas which in turn negatively influence the food security and environmental status of these regions. Srinagar city is the largest urban centre across whole Himalayan region and is experiencing considerably high rates of population growth and areal expansion. The city has recently been ranked as one among the first hundred fastest growing urban centers throughout the world. Therefore in present study an attempt has been made to analyse and simulate the trends and patterns of population growth and spatial expansion of this fast growing Himalayan urban centre.","Agriculture; Himalayan; Mountainous; Transport corridors.; Urban sprawl; Wetlands","agricultural development; migration; mountain region; population growth; transportation development; trend analysis; urban area; urban development; urbanization; wetland; Himalayas; India; Jammu and Kashmir; Srinagar [Jammu and Kashmir]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905014889

We parameterized these three models with identical data from different regions of the world; one region undergoing extensive agricultural expansion (East Africa), another region where forests are re-growing (Muskegon River Watershed in the United States), and a third region where urbanization is prominent (South-Eastern Wisconsin in the United States). Independent training data and testing data were used to train and calibrate each model, respectively. Comparisons of simulated maps from the three kinds of land use change patterns were made using conventional goodness-of-fit metrics in land use change science. The results of temporal and spatial comparison of the data mining models show that the artificial neural network outperformed all other models in a short-time interval (East Africa; 5 years) and for coarse resolution data (East Africa; 1km); however, the three data mining models obtained similar accuracies in a long-time interval (Muskegon River Watershed; 20 years) and for fine resolution data with large numbers of cells (Muskegon River Watershed; 30m). Furthermore, the results showed that the probability of agriculture gain was more likely in locations closer to towns and large cities in East Africa, urbanization was more likely in locations closer to roads and urban areas in South-Eastern Wisconsin and the probability of forest gain was more likely in locations closer to the forest and shrub land cover and farther away from roads in Muskegon River Watershed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Binary land use change simulation; Data mining; Global parametric model; Local non-parametric model; Spatial and temporal comparison","Agricultural robots; Forestry; Land use; Location; Neural networks; Rivers; Watersheds; Agricultural expansion; Classification and regression tree; Land use change modeling; Land-use change; Multivariate adaptive regression splines; Non-parametric model; Parametric modeling; Spatial and temporal comparison; Data mining; artificial neural network; global perspective; land use change; simulation; spatiotemporal analysis; urbanization; Forestry; Land Use; Models; Neural Networks; Rivers; Water Sheds; East Africa; Michigan; Muskegon Basin; United States; Wisconsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904599862

We present a dynamic model that integrates land loads of nitrogen and phosphorus, cost of nutrient abatement measures in agriculture, nutrient dynamics in the sea basins adjoining the Finnish coast, exogenous risk of oil spills, and recreational value of the sea, which faces environmental damage of uncertain magnitude and duration. Monte Carlo simulation is applied to evaluate the profitability of nutrient abatement measures carried out unilaterally by Finland or as a joint effort by Estonia, Finland and Russia. We demonstrate that a high exogenous risk of oil damage may render investments in nutrient abatement economically infeasible. On the other hand, several components of the model entail uncertainties owing to the scarcity of data and our limited understanding of the relationship between the ecological processes involved and the values people place on natural resources. For example, the uncertainties related to the curvature of the value function outweigh the uncertainties connected with the oil spills and their potential consequences. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Monte Carlo simulation; Nutrient abatement measures; Probability; Recreation; Valuation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904561587

However, the number of mixed crop-livestock farms has been falling steadily in Europe, where production has become concentrated on specialised and enlarged farms. This study aimed to design and assess technical innovations which could enhance the sustainability of mixed farming in the difficult conditions of Less Favoured Areas. It was conducted in a hilly region in south-western France where mixed crop-livestock farming continues to be practiced. Innovative technical scenarios consistent with the two main adaptive strategies implemented by local mixed farms were selected with farmers and other stakeholders. The first, the ""maximising farm autonomy"" strategy, consisted of sowing forage legumes between two cash crops to achieve herd feed self-sufficiency while maintaining soil fertility. The second, the ""diversifying production"" management strategy, consisted of adding a heifer fattening unit to increase farm income. Both scenarios were assessed on two actual farms using a whole farm simulation tool, CLIFS, based on feed and manure balances. They then were combined with prospective scenarios on public policies and markets to analyse farmers' capacity to cope with changes in their economic environment. Under current conditions, the two technical innovations allowed an increase of the total gross margin per hectare of cultivated area by respectively 8.9% and 17.1%. However, under contrasting future political and economic conditions, they were unable to mitigate the impact of drastic shocks. Public policy support would likely be needed to maintain local mixed crop-livestock farms in these contexts. The combination of discussions and simulations using concrete farm cases ensured a lively dialogue between researchers, farmers, and professionals. The process combined a broad range of empirical, technical and scientific knowledge and enriched both individual and collective learning. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Farming system design; Future study; Participatory research; Simulation; Technical innovation","agricultural management; agricultural policy; farmers knowledge; mixed farming; mountain region; simulation; stakeholder; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903886940

Significant progress has been made in monitoring and forecasting water deficits, both temporally and spatially. However, less progress has been made in translating this information into proactive decision-making frameworks to support drought preparedness. The Invitational Drought Tournament (IDT), a simulation adaptation framework developed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, is a recent innovation that supports drought preparedness efforts. The IDT provides a mechanism for presenting physical science information to decision makers across a variety of educational levels and professional backgrounds, in a way that allows for peer-to-peer education and synthesis. Second, the game simulation environment allows players to integrate this information into economic, policy and institutional frameworks in a non-threatening manner. Third, it maintains realism by constraining players' risk management options via a budget, the physical realities of the drought presented, and the technical expertise of the 'referees'. Post-game follow-up allows players to explore lessons learned and to identify topics that warrant further in-depth exploration of policy options and subsequent implementation. The game provides an interim step between recognition of the risk posed by drought hazards and the actual implementation of vulnerability-reduction actions. This allows for a broad discussion within a sports-themed process that provides room for reflection and a richer understanding of the issues that must be addressed to ensure drought preparedness actions are effective. © 2014.","Climate adaptation; Drought management; Drought preparedness and response planning; Multi-stakeholder engagement and scenario planning; Simulation gaming; Social learning","adaptation; drought stress; implementation process; innovation; institutional framework; learning; stakeholder; water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902507461

However, the long-term effects of transportation infrastructure are not well understood; these include land-use changes, changes in landscape patterns, and the alteration of ecosystem services. To assess the effects of different land-use scenarios under various agricultural and environmental conservation policy regimes, this study applies an integrated approach to analyze the effects of Highway 6 construction on Puli Township. Interviews with neighborhood leaders of Puli Township, along with remote sensing analysis, reveal that both biophysical and socioeconomic factors are the major forces driving land-use change. The effects of these land-use changes are varied. An example is the road-effect zone, which for Puli Township extends 400. m perpendicular to the length of the highway; however, due to differing spatial patterns it is highly asymmetric; indirect effects include the spatial restructuring of certain landscapes, which can drastically influence habitat dynamics. Land-use simulation results indicate that agricultural and environmental conservation policies have significant effects on projected land-use patterns in the southern part of Puli's downtown area and in areas along major roads. Specifically, highway construction and subsequent urbanization under various land-use policies result in varying degrees of isolation and fragmentation in the overall landscape pattern. A habitat quality assessment using the InVEST model indicates that the conservation of agricultural and forested lands improves habitat quality and preserves rare habitats.

However, some authors report that the introduction of irrigation systems that apply water more uniformly may actually increase water catchment depletion: the so-called 'rebound effect'. In this paper a simple model that combines irrigation, agronomic, and microeconomic concepts is used to systematically analyze the conditions under which improved irrigation application uniformity may lead to increased water use and/or consumption. The analysis is illustrated with examples from the experience with irrigation modernization in Spain. Water demand (the value of marginal water productivity) becomes inelastic as the irrigation application uniformity increases. The increase in water depletion due to the introduction of more uniform irrigation systems is insignificant if land is limited and farmers optimize their profit. If land is not a limiting factor, new water abstractions are likely to occur, potentially leading to a vicious circle in which irrigated land expands while water resources become overexploited. This cycle tends to slow down as irrigation application uniformity increases. More accurate water accounting is suggested as an instrument for controlling water depletion complementary to investing in irrigation efficiency when water conservation at the basin scale is the main objective. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Irrigation uniformity; Jevons paradox; Rebound effect; Water conservation; Water consumption; Water use","agricultural economics; agronomy; investment; irrigation system; modernization; profitability; water demand; water planning; water resource; water use; water yield; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901248328

The regional vulnerability of wheat production to climate change in India was assessed by quantifying the impacts and adaptation gains in a simulation analysis using the InfoCrop-WHEAT model. This study projects that climate change will reduce the wheat yield in India in the range of 6 to 23% by 2050 and 15 to 25% by 2080. Even though the magnitude of the projected impacts is variable, the direction is similar in the climate scenarios of both a global (GCM-MIROC3.2.HI) and a regional climate model (RCM-PRECIS). Negative impacts of climate change are projected to be less severe in low-emission scenarios than in high-emission scenarios. The magnitude of uncertainty varies spatially and increases with time. Differences in sowing time is one of the major reasons for variable impacts on yield. Late-sown areas are projected to suffer more than the timely-sown ones. Considerable spatial variation in impacts is projected. Warmer central and south-central regions of India may be more affected. Despite CO2 fertilization benefits in future climate, wheat yield is projected to be reduced in areas with mean seasonal maximum and minimum temperatures in excess of 27 and 13°C, respectively. However, simple adaptation options, such as change in sowing times, and increased and efficient use of inputs, could not only offset yield reduction, but could also improve yields until the middle of the century. Converting late-sown areas into timely-sown regions could further significantly improve yield even with the existing varieties in the near future. However, some regions may still remain vulnerable despite the adaptation interventions considered. Therefore, this study emphasises the need for intensive, innovative and location-specific adaptations to improve wheat productivity in the future climate. © Inter-Research 2014.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change; Impacts; Indo-gangetic plains; Irrigated system; Wheat","Agriculture; Computer simulation; Adaptation; Impacts; Indo-Gangetic Plains; Irrigated system; Wheat; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; crop production; crop yield; regional climate; sowing; spatial variation; vulnerability; wheat; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900453995

Wetlands in the Hawaiian archipelago (U.S.A.) support human water demands for agriculture, a rapidly expanding urban population, and 222 federally listed threatened or endangered plants and animals. The only published assessment of wetland loss for Hawai'i was done in 1990, before significant advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and computing technology. We estimated wetland loss on the 5 main Hawaiian Islands since human settlement using the National Wetlands Inventory, hydric soil maps, rainfall, and topographic data. We used the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) to estimate pre-settlement wetlands in sites where hydric soil evidence was unavailable or unreliable. We found that TWI makes a useful complement to hydric soil evidence in estimating wetland loss in highly developed areas. We estimate statewide wetland loss at 15 %, compared to 12 % from the 1990 estimate, ranging from 6 to 8 % loss on Maui, Molokaì, Hawai'i, and Kauài to 65%loss on Oahu, the most developed of the islands.

A prediction of HPAI dispersion is challenging considering various spread factors, such as indirect transmission by airborne spread as well as direct transmission through contact by humans, vehicles, wild animals, and migratory birds. Because of the complexity of the spread of HPAI, it is difficult to provide prompt treatments against epidemics. Moreover, there is little information on the airborne spread of the HPAI virus because of the limitations of field experiments for determining the mechanism of the spread of the disease due to the difficulty of making accurate measurements in the presence of unstable and uncontrollable weather conditions. In this study, CFD (computational fluid dynamics) was used to estimate the dispersion of the virus attached to aerosols produced by livestock using a GIS (geographical information system) to model a three-dimensional specific topography that includes the farm location, road network, and related facilities. The CFD simulation was conducted to predict the dispersion of virus from source farms according to various wind conditions. The weather conditions during the period of interest were analysed using CFD simulations to complete a frequency matrix form.

Increasing salinity in crop root zones often decreases crop yields and crop revenues. Salinity effects are nonlinear, and vary with crop choice and other factors including drainage and residence time of irrigation water. Here, we explore changes in agricultural production in the Delta under various combinations of water management, large-scale flooding, and future sea level rise. Water management alternatives include through-Delta water exports (current conditions), dual conveyance (through-Delta and a 6,700 Mm3 yr-1 [or 7500 cfs] capacity peripheral canal or tunnel) and the flooding of five western islands with and without peripheral exports. We employ results from previous hydrodynamic simulations of likely changes in salinity for irrigation water at points in the Delta. We connect these irrigation water salinity values into a detailed agro-economic model of Delta agriculture to estimate local crop yield and farm revenue losses. Previous hydrodynamic modeling work shows that sea level rise is likely to increase salinity from 4% to 130% in this century, depending on the increase in sea level and location. Changes in water management under dual conveyance increase salinity mostly in the western Delta, and to a lesser extent in the north, where current salinity levels are now quite low. Because locations likely to experience the largest salinity increases already have a lower-value crop mix, the worst-case losses are less than 1% of total Delta crop revenues. This result also holds for salinity increases from permanent flooding of western islands that serve as a salinity barrier. Our results suggest that salinity increases could have much smaller economic effects on Delta farming than other likely changes in the Delta such as retirement of agricultural lands after large-scale flooding and habitat development. Integrating hydrodynamic, water salinity, and economic models can provide insights into controversial management issues. © 2014 by the article author(s).","Agricultural production; Calibration; California; Climate change, sea level rise, large area flooding; Drought analysis; Economic effects; Hydro-economic models; Positive mathematical programming; Sacramento-San joaquin delta; Salinity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897092693

Reducing this type of pollution is one of today's key socio-economic and environmental challenges. At the regional level, few approaches enable the actors concerned to implement agricultural management strategies to reduce the use and impact of phytosanitary products. Our research problem focused on the consequences of intensive agriculture and, in particular, how to evaluate the impact of phytosanitary products on human health and the environment. In this article, we present the SimPhy simulation game which places the actors from a given region directly into a situation in which they manage farms whilst under pressure to reduce phytosanitaries (quantity and toxicity). The application focused on the Merja Zerga catchment area in Morocco. The region is dominated by intensive agriculture which is located upstream from a Ramsar-classified wetland area. The SimPhy simulation game is based on a decision support system-type tool. It allows us to anticipate the impact of regulations on farming systems. It also enables us to analyse the consequences of the actors' strategies on farm economies, human health and the quality of ecosystems.

By quantifying the effect of trade on crop production on grid-cell level and combining it with cell- and crop-specific virtual water contents, we are able to determine green and blue water consumption and savings. Connecting the information on trade-related blue water usage to water shadow prices gives us the possibility to value the impact of international food crop trade on local blue water resources. To determine the trade-related value of the blue water usage, we employ two models: first, an economic land- and water-use model, simulating agricultural trade, production and water-shadow prices and second, a global vegetation and agricultural model, modeling the blue and green virtual water content of the traded crops. Our study found that globally, the international trade of food crops saves blue water worth 2.4. billion US$. This net saving occurs despite the fact that Europe exports virtual blue water in food crops worth 3.1 billion US$. Countries in the Middle East and South Asia profit from trade by importing water intensive crops, countries in Southern Europe on the other hand export water intensive agricultural goods from water scarce sites, deteriorating local water scarcity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural trade; Blue and green water; Virtual water; Water scarcity","crop yield; environmental economics; intensive agriculture; international trade; simulation; trade-environment relations; water planning; water use; Middle East; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896097451

Cumulative time spent in poverty is simulated using Markovian processes, which show that accessibility to markets and land use system are especially important for decreasing poverty among households in our sample. Wealtheir households are selected into commercial production of perennials before our initial observation, and are therefore in poverty a lower proportion of the time. Land in pasture, in contrast, has an independent effect on reducing the proportion of time spent in poverty.

Over recent decades, these communities have undergone drastic changes in economic structure, population size and land use. Our understanding of the exact mechanisms that drive these changes is limited, and there is also a lack of integrative approaches to enable decision makers to steer rural development towards a more sustainable path. In this study, we build a dynamic simulation model to calculate the trade-offs between the provisions of two ecosystem services - landscape aesthetic value and water supply for human use - and the economic development associated with different land use changes. The study area for the simulation comprises two rural communities located in southern Spain. Our results show trade-offs between economic development and the provision of the selected ecosystem services in the selected study area. Land use intensification results in economic development but is not enough to prevent population loss and has a negative impact on both the water supply and on aesthetic services. We conclude that more proactive management policies are needed to mitigate a loss in ecosystem services. Simulation models like ours may facilitate the choice of these policies, as they could test the result of land use planning policies contributing therefore, to a more integrative and sustainable management of rural communities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Land use change; Rural management; System dynamics","decision making; economic development; ecosystem service; land management; land use change; mountain; numerical model; rural area; simulation; sustainable development; agriculture; article; controlled study; economic development; employment; environmental management; environmental planning; esthetics; human; income; land use; landscape ecology; normal human; rural area; rural population; simulation; social evolution; socioeconomics; Spain; time series analysis; urbanization; water supply; Spain; Land use change; Rural management; System dynamics; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Economic Development; Ecosystem; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887003253

Public support systems may play two different roles, one as a device to deliver disaster assistance and another to enhance insurance for marketable risks. This paper contributes to the literature by analysing the trade-offs between providing catastrophic assistance and subsidizing insurance premiums. The goal of the study is to highlight policy options that are coherent in stabilizing income volatility while limiting distortions of public intervention. In this study, farmer incomes were first modelled using Monte Carlo simulation, and options were then ranked by applying the stochastic efficiency with respect to a function. The results suggest that, if catastrophic assistance is available, even higher insurance support is needed to make it a preferred option. The results highlight the fact that well defined and credible ex ante rules for the use of disaster assistance are essential to enable insurance markets to develop. One possibility would be to make a farmer's eligibility for disaster aid conditional on his or her participation in the insurance programmes.","Catastrophic assistance; Common agricultural policy; European union; Insurance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893179297

The Brahmaputra-Ganges catchments have a large population, a main industry of agriculture and a growing hydro-power industry, making the region susceptible to changes in the Indian Summer Monsoon, annually the main water source. The HighNoon project has completed four regional climate model simulations for India and the Himalaya at high resolution (25. km) from 1960 to 2100 to provide an ensemble of simulations for the region. In this paper we have assessed the ensemble for these catchments, comparing the simulations with observations, to give credence that the simulations provide a realistic representation of atmospheric processes and therefore future climate. We have illustrated how these simulations could be used to provide information on potential future climate impacts and therefore aid decision-making using climatology and threshold analysis. The ensemble analysis shows an increase in temperature between the baseline (1970-2000) and the 2050s (2040-2070) of between 2 and 4. °C and an increase in the number of days with maximum temperatures above 28. °C and 35. °C. There is less certainty for precipitation and runoff which show considerable variability, even in this relatively small ensemble, spanning zero. The HighNoon ensemble is the most complete data for the region providing useful information on a wide range of variables for the regional climate of the Brahmaputra-Ganges region, however there are processes not yet included in the models that could have an impact on the simulations of future climate. We have discussed these processes and show that the range from the HighNoon ensemble is similar in magnitude to potential changes in projections where these processes are included. Therefore strategies for adaptation must be robust and flexible allowing for advances in the science and natural environmental changes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Brahmaputra; Climate; Ganges; Models; Monsoon; Regional","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Catchments; Decision making; Electric power system interconnection; Models; Runoff; Brahmaputra; Climate; Ganges; Monsoon; Regional; Climate models; adaptive management; catchment; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; computer simulation; environmental change; monsoon; regional climate; runoff; temperature effect; adaptation; article; atmospheric dispersion; climate change; controlled study; environmental change; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; environmental temperature; Indian; irrigation (agriculture); land use; priority journal; simulation; soil property; Ganges Delta; Himalayas; India; Brahmaputra; Climate; Ganges; Models; Monsoon; Regional; Agriculture; Climate; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environment; Forecasting; India; Models, Theoretical; Seasons; Temperature; Water Resources; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891743201

Numerous studies have found these wetlands, which number in the millions, to be highly sensitive to climate variability. Here, we compare wetland conditions between two 30-year periods (1946-1975; 1976-2005) using a hindcast simulation approach to determine if recent climate warming in the region has already resulted in changes in wetland condition. Simulations using the WETLANDSCAPE model show that 20th century climate change may have been sufficient to have a significant impact on wetland cover cycling. Modeled wetlands in the PPR's western Canadian prairies show the most dramatic effects: a recent trend toward shorter hydroperiods and less dynamic vegetation cycles, which already may have reduced the productivity of hundreds of wetland-dependent species. © 2013 The Authors.","Climate change; Cover cycle; Hindcasting; North American wetlands; PPR; Prairie Pothole Region; Prairie wetlands; Simulation; Wetlands",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887801034

Compared with the simulations at 12- and 4-km, the 1.33-km simulation shows large improvement in most meteorological predictions in July and some chemical predictions in January and July 2002. Limited improvements at 1.33-km and 4-km are attributed to current limitations in meteorological parameterizations and lack of accurate data for land use and emissions at a fine scale. NH3 plays an important role in PM2.5 formation, but the emission control strategies focus only on SO2 and NOx in the southeastern U.S. To understand the impact of NH3, NH3 to NH4+ conversion and the chemical regimes of PM2.5 formation are examined. The conversion rates of NH3 to NH4+ from CMAQ and CAMx simulations are 10-60% in January and 10-50% in July at and near major sources. The eastern North Carolina and northeastern Georgia are NH3-rich and the remaining areas are NH3-neutral in both months. To further assess the impact of NH3 emission reductions, the sensitivity of CMAQ to emission reductions is evaluated for four emission scenarios: reducing emissions of SO2, NOx, agricultural livestock-NH3 (AL-NH3) by 50%, respectively and collectively. The largest reductions of PM2.5 are by up to 19.2% in January and 18.3% in July when all these emissions are reduced by 50%. AL-NH3 reductions result in the largest decrease in January by up to 16%, dominated by a reduction in NH4NO3, while SO2 reductions result in the largest decrease in July (up to 11%) due to decreases in NH4+ and SO42-. This indicates that reducing AL-NH3 emissions together with SO2 and NOx emissions can reduce PM2.5 concentrations more than reducing emissions of SO2 and NOx alone, particularly in winter. Future emission control strategies for PM2.5 controlling should consider the reduction of NH3 emissions, in addition to the emissions of SO2 and NOx. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","CAMx; CMAQ; Emission reduction; Fine scale modeling; Sensitivity simulation","CAMx; CMAQ; Emission reduction; Fine-scale; Sensitivity Simulation; Agriculture; Air quality; Aluminum; Emission control; Forecasting; Public policy; Sulfur dioxide; Reduction; agricultural emission; air quality; ecological impact; emission control; land use; simulation; winter; Georgia; North Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885026614

The study uses 57 simulations to better understand impacts on water, food and economic security and their interactions, in order to highlight potential pathways towards a more sustainable future for the Rosetta region. Current water resource over-exploitation can be mitigated while still allowing for agricultural development. The utility of the system dynamics paradigm in modelling complex systems is highlighted, with the potential to extend the methodology to other studies. While most simulations hinted at continued over-exploitation, some suggest that improvements can be achieved by altering parameters such as per-capita domestic water demand and/or the cropping regime. Many policies should be considered in parallel to introduce redundancy into the policy framework. From initial results, it was hypothesised that by producing excess crops, international markets could be exploited, leading to further improvements in the water balance, yield and revenue. A model extension was built which suggested that improvements are possible, furthering local development. However, these improvements would probably manifest after years, have to be managed carefully, and would increase reliance on other countries. © IWA Publishing 2013.","Agricultural development; Global change; Integrated system dynamics modelling; Water security","Agricultural development; Agricultural yields; Global change; Integrated modelling; Integrated systems; International markets; Local development; Water security; Agriculture; Integrated control; International trade; Water resources; System theory; agricultural development; global change; modeling; sustainability; water budget; water management; water use; Egypt; Rosetta Promontory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884217535

In this study, a system dynamic multi-agent model adopting the soil water balance provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56 was developed to explore how farmers' decision making may affect future water needs and use with a focus on the role of climate services, i.e. forecasts and insurance. A climatic projection record representing the down-scaled A1B market scenario (a balance across all sources) of the assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is used to produce future daily data about relative humidity, precipitation, temperature and wind speed. Two types of meteorological services are made available: i) a bi-weekly bulletin; and ii) seasonal forecasts. The precision of these services was altered to represent different conditions, from perfect knowledge to poor forecasts. Using the available forecasts, farming agents take adaptation decisions concerning crop allocation and irrigation management on the basis of their own risk attitudes. Farmers' attitudes are characterized by fuzzy classifications depending on age, relative income and crop profitability. Farming agents' adaptation decisions directly affect the crop and irrigation parameters, which in turn affect future water needs on a territorial level. By incorporating available and future meteorological services, the model allows the farmer's decision making-process to be explored together with the consequent future irrigation water demand for the period 2015 to 2030. The model prototype is applied to a data set of the Venice Lagoon Watershed, an area of 2038 km2 in north-east Italy, for a preliminary test of its performance and to design future development objectives. © S.

The relative importance and the spatial distribution of these factors on forest and agricultural derived ES, however, is unclear, making the implementation of ES management schemes difficult. Using an integrated economic-ecological modeling framework, we evaluated the impact of these driving forces on the provision of forest and agricultural ES in a mountain region of southern Switzerland. Results imply that forest ES will be strongly influenced by the direct impact of climate change, but that changes in land use will have a comparatively small impact. The simulation of direct impacts of climate change affects forest ES at all elevations, while land use changes can only be found at high elevations. In contrast, changes to agricultural ES were found to be primarily due to shifts in economic conditions that alter land use and land management. The direct influence of climate change on agriculture is only predicted to be substantial at high elevations, while socioeconomic driven shifts in land use are projected to affect agricultural ES at all elevations. Our simulation results suggest that policy schemes designed to mitigate the negative impact of climate change on forests should focus on suitable adaptive management plans, accelerating adaptation processes for currently forested areas. To maintain provision of agricultural ES policy needs to focus on economic conditions rather than on supporting adaptation to new climate. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Bio-economic modeling; Climate change impact; Ecosystem services; Land use change","adaptive management; agricultural ecosystem; biophysics; climate effect; ecological economics; ecological modeling; economic analysis; ecosystem service; forest ecosystem; integrated approach; land use change; market transition; mountain region; spatial distribution; agricultural land; agriculture; article; climate change; economics; environmental protection; forest; global change; land use; policy; simulation; socioeconomics; Switzerland; Bio-economic modeling; Climate change impact; Ecosystem services; Land use change; Agriculture; Altitude; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forestry; Human Activities; Humans; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883333166

Up to now, only a few suitable tools and methods have existed for farmers and regional stakeholders that support the process of decision-making in this field. The interactive model-based spatial information and decision support system LandCaRe DSS attempts to close the existing methodical gap. This system supports interactive spatial scenario simulations, multi-ensemble and multi-model simulations at the regional scale, as well as the complex impact assessment of potential land use adaptation strategies at the local scale. The system is connected to a local geo-database and via the internet to a climate data server. LandCaRe DSS uses a multitude of scale-specific ecological impact models, which are linked in various ways. At the local scale (farm scale), biophysical models are directly coupled with a farm economy calculator. New or alternative simulation models can easily be added, thanks to the innovative architecture and design of the DSS. Scenario simulations can be conducted with a reasonable amount of effort. The interactive LandCaRe DSS prototype also offers a variety of data analysis and visualisation tools, a help system for users and a farmer information system for climate adaptation in agriculture. This paper presents the theoretical background, the conceptual framework, and the structure and methodology behind LandCaRe DSS. Scenario studies at the regional and local scale for the two Eastern German regions of Uckermark (dry lowlands, 2600km2) and Weißeritz (humid mountain area, 400km2) were conducted in close cooperation with stakeholders to test the functionality of the DSS prototype. The system is gradually being transformed into a web version (http://www.landcare-dss.de) to ensure the broadest possible distribution of LandCaRe DSS to the public. The system will be continuously developed, updated and used in different research projects and as a learning and knowledge-sharing tool for students.The main objective of LandCaRe DSS is to provide information on the complex long-term impacts of climate change and on potential management options for adaptation by answering ""what-if"" type questions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Agricultural adaptation strategies; Decision support system; GIS model coupling; Impact assessment; Land use management; Model integration; Scenario studies; Simulation model","agricultural land; climate change; climate effect; conceptual framework; decision making; decision support system; information system; land use; regional planning; stakeholder; agricultural land; article; climate change; conceptual framework; decision support system; economic evaluation; environmental management; environmental planning; information processing; Internet; simulation; Brandenburg [Germany]; Germany; Uckermark; Agricultural adaptation strategies; Decision support system; GIS model coupling; Impact assessment; Land use management; Model integration; Scenario studies; Simulation model; Agriculture; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Decision Support Techniques; Geographic Information Systems; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881668920

This may change, however, when energy prices increase and their production is combined with the provision of other services. The current analysis explores the potential for the production of an often overlooked biomass feedstock that can be combined with water and nature management objectives: reed. This crop has the additional advantage that it can be grown under conditions that are unfavourable to most other crops. An economics-based land-use modelling approach is applied to simulate the local competition between reed and grassland used for dairy farming under four different future scenarios in the Netherlands. Based on a location-specific assessment of potential costs and benefits of these crops under scenario-based conditions this analysis shows that the cultivation of reed for bioenergy, in combination with providing additional land-use functions, while not viable option under current economic and political conditions, may become competitive within the next twenty years if any of the following developments occur: energy prices increase substantially; water tables rise in the low-lying western parts of the country due to climate change; a policy is implemented that increases bioenergy prices; or a policy is implemented that stimulates water buffering and the preservation of peat soils. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Cost-benefit analysis; Land use simulation; Landscape services; Reed; The Netherlands; Water management","Biomass feedstock; Costs and benefits; Ethanol production; Landscape services; Management objectives; Netherlands; Political conditions; Reed; Biofuels; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Crops; Cultivation; Land use; Soils; Water management; Cost benefit analysis; biofuel; biomass power; combustion; competition (ecology); cost-benefit analysis; ecological modeling; economic analysis; energy crop; reedbed; water management; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879346289

To date, however, their usefulness for informing climate risk and variability in policy and social applications has been understudied. Here, we apply tree-ring based reconstructions of drought for the last 700 years in a climate index insurance framework to show that additional information from long climate reconstructions significantly improves our understanding of the underlying climate distributions and variability. We further show that this added information can be used to better characterize risk to insurance providers, in many cases providing meaningful reductions in long-term contract costs to farmers in stand-alone policies. The impact of uncertainty on insurance premiums can also be reduced when insurers diversify portfolios, and the availability of long-term climate information from tree rings across a broad geographic range provides an opportunity to characterize spatial correlation in climate risk across geographic regions. Our results are robust to the range of climate variability experienced over the last 400 years and in model simulations of the twenty-first century, even within the context of changing baselines due to low frequency variability and secular climate trends. These results demonstrate the utility of longer-term climate histories in index insurance applications. Furthermore, they make the case from a climate-variability perspective for the continued importance of such approaches to improving the instrumental climate record, even into a non-stationary climate future. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Index insurance; Non-stationarity; Paleoclimate; Tree rings","agri-environmental policy; agricultural worker; climate variation; cost-benefit analysis; geographical region; index method; numerical model; paleoclimate; policy making; proxy climate record; reconstruction; resolution; sustainability; tree ring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878594488

Different irrigation treatments were evaluated and compared in terms of beneficial water use and physical and economical water productivity for two commodity prices and three irrigation systems scenarios applied to a medium and a large field of 5 and 32. ha respectively. Results show that deficit treatments may lead to better water productivity indicators but deficit irrigation (DI) feasibility is highly dependent on the commodity prices. Various well-designed and managed pressurized irrigation systems' scenarios - center-pivot, set sprinkler systems and drip tape systems - were compared and ranked using multicriteria analysis. For this, three different prioritization schemes were considered, one referring to water savings, another relative to economic results, and a third one representing a balanced situation between the first two. The rankings of alternative solutions were very sensitive to the decision-maker priorities, mainly when comparing water saving and economic results because the selected alternatives were generally not common to both priority schemes. However, some of the best alternatives for the balanced priorities scheme are common to the other two, thus suggesting a possible trade-off when selecting the best alternatives. Deficit irrigation strategies also rank differently for the various scenarios considered. The study shows that deficit irrigation with exception of mild DI is generally not economically feasible. The adoption of well designed and managed irrigation systems requires consideration of priorities of farm management in terms of water saving and economic results since that some water saving solutions do not allow appropriate recover of the investment costs, particularly with DI. Basing decisions upon multicriteria analysis allows farmers and decision-makers to better select irrigation systems and related management decisions. Results also indicate that appropriate support must be given to farmers when adopting high performance but expensive irrigation systems aimed at sustainable crop profitability. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Alternative irrigation systems; Deficit irrigation; Economic water productivity; Irrigation and production costs; Multicriteria analysis","Alternative irrigations; Deficit irrigation; Multi Criteria Analysis; Production cost; Water productivity; Agriculture; Computer simulation; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economic analysis; Profitability; Sprinkler systems (fire fighting); Sprinkler systems (irrigation); Tape recorders; Water conservation; Water supply; Water management; cost-benefit analysis; decision making; drip irrigation; maize; numerical model; price dynamics; prioritization; trade-off; water management; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878464921

Design: Systematic review. Setting: Global. Search strategy: We systematically searched five databases for published literature (MEDLINE, EconLit, Agricola, AgEcon Search, Scopus) and systematically browsed other databases and relevant organisational websites for unpublished literature. Reference lists of included publications were hand-searched for additional relevant studies. We included studies that evaluated or simulated the effects of national or international food-price-related agricultural policies on nutrition outcomes reporting data collected after 1990 and published in English. Primary and secondary outcomes: Prevalence rates of undernutrition (measured with anthropometry or clinical deficiencies) and overnutrition (obesity and nutrition-related chronic diseases including cancer, heart disease and diabetes). Results: We identified a total of four relevant reports; two ex post evaluations and two ex ante simulations. A study from India reported on the undernutrition rates in children, and the other three studies from Egypt, the Netherlands and the USA reported on the nutrition-related chronic disease outcomes in adults. Two of the studies assessed the impact of policies that subsidised the price of agricultural outputs and two focused on public food distribution policies. The limited evidence base provided some support for the notion that agricultural policies that change the prices of foods at a national level can have an effect on population-level nutrition and health outcomes. Conclusions: A systematic review of the available literature suggests that there is a paucity of robust direct evidence on the impact of agricultural price policies on nutrition and health.",,"anthropometry; body mass; body weight; disability adjusted life year; food; food intake; human; incidence; India; life expectancy; malnutrition; morbidity; mortality; nutrition; nutritional status; overnutrition; policy; prevalence; quality of life; review; systematic review; treatment outcome; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879901354

On the basis of public statistical data and field research data, this paper analyzed the magnitude of livestock manure excretion and pollution of China and different provinces in 2010, and predicted development tendencies of livestock manure excretion and pollution in 2020 through the Decision Support System for China's Agricultural Sustainable Development (CHINAGRO). The result shows that total livestock manure excretion of China in 2010 is 1 900 million tons, and livestock manure pollution is 227 million tons, while per hectare arable land of livestock manure pollution is 1.86 tons. Provinces in the southeast China, such as Guangdong and Fujian, are areas with high pressure of livestock manure pollution. Model simulation shows that China's total amount of livestock manure pollution will increase to 298 million tons in 2020 without government intervention. The pressure of livestock manure pollution will become higher in most regions of China, especially in east and south regions. The situation in central and western region is better than that in east regions although the pollution pressure will also increase in those areas. Policy intervention such as taxes and subsidies should be adopted to reduce the discharge of livestock manure pollution, and encourage livestock production transfer from eastern areas to the central and western regions.","Environmental pollution; Livestock manure; Model projection; Policy implication; Regional distribution","animal; article; China; environmental protection; forecasting; livestock; manure; pollution; poultry; statistics; theoretical model; waste management; Animals; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Pollution; Forecasting; Livestock; Manure; Models, Theoretical; Poultry; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880673028

Age and education have a significant impact on consumer demand for diet quality, but income does not. The own-price elasticities of demand for diet quality are inelastic.

Transport of pollutants emitted in one region to another region may add to the impact of local emissions. In this work, Lagrangian particle dispersion model simulations show the amounts of tracers that are transported within and among four regions, Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area, the Central Valley, and the rest of the state. The simulations cover May and June of 2010, the California Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change experiment period. Tracers of automobile emissions and one type of agricultural emission are used. Tracer mixing ratios are compared to airborne and ground-based measurements. The age of tracers in each location is also presented. Vertical profiles and diurnal cycles help to clarify the transport process. As is well known, Southern California emissions are transported to the east and affect the desert areas, and Bay Area automobile emissions are an important source of pollutants in the San Joaquin Valley. A novel result is that the Southern California Bight is filled with a mixture of well-aged carbon monoxide tracer from Southern California and the Bay Area. Air over the Bight is also affected by the agricultural emissions represented by the agricultural tracer, dominantly from the Central Valley where its sources are largest. There is no indication of transport from Southern California to the Central Valley. Emissions from the Central Valley do make their way to Southern California, as shown by the agricultural tracer, but automobile emissions from the Valley are insignificant in Southern California.

Aging in SSA is associated with unique challenges because of poverty and inadequate social supports. However, despite its importance for understanding the consequences of population aging, the evidence about the prevalence of disabilities and functional limitations due to poor physical health among older adults in SSA continues to be very limited.Methods and Findings:Participants came from 2006, 2008, and 2010 waves of the Malawi Longitudinal Survey of Families and Health, a study of the rural population in Malawi. We investigate how poor physical health results in functional limitations that limit the day-to-day activities of individuals in domains relevant to this subsistence-agriculture context. These disabilities were parameterized based on questions from the SF-12 questionnaire about limitations in daily living activities. We estimated age-specific patterns of functional limitations and the transitions over time between different disability states using a discrete-time hazard model. The estimated transition rates were then used to calculate the first (to our knowledge) microdata-based health expectancies calculated for SSA. The risks of experiencing functional limitations due to poor physical health are high in this population, and the onset of disabilities happens early in life. Our analyses show that 45-y-old women can expect to spend 58% (95% CI, 55%-64%) of their remaining 28 y of life (95% CI, 25.7-33.5) with functional limitations; 45-y-old men can expect to live 41% (95% CI, 35%-46%) of their remaining 25.4 y (95% CI, 23.3-28.8) with such limitations. Disabilities related to functional limitations are shown to have a substantial negative effect on individuals' labor activities, and are negatively related to subjective well-being.Conclusions:Individuals in this population experience a lengthy struggle with disabling conditions in adulthood, with high probabilities of remitting and relapsing between states of functional limitation. Given the strong association of disabilities with work efforts and subjective well-being, this research suggests that current national health policies and international donor-funded health programs in SSA inadequately target the physical health of mature and older adults.Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary. © 2013 Payne et al.",,"adult; aged; article; controlled study; daily life activity; disability; female; health; health survey; human; life expectancy; longitudinal study; major clinical study; Malawi; male; mortality; physical activity; population dynamics; prevalence; probability; questionnaire; social support; socioeconomics; Activities of Daily Living; Age Factors; Aged; Aging; Computer Simulation; Cost of Illness; Disability Evaluation; Employment; Female; Health Status; Health Transition; Humans; Life Expectancy; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Malawi; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Rural Health; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878280620

In 2010, stakeholders representing interests from agriculture, municipalities, environment, and more formed the Bow River Project Research Consortium to help determine the potential for improving the operations in the basin. At present, upstream reservoirs are operated primarily for hydropower, whereas downstream reservoirs are operated for irrigation. Through Collaborative Modeling for Decision Support the stakeholders were able to develop a new method for operating the system that would dramatically improve environmental performance. The main components of the new operating strategy called for: purchase or setting aside of a small amount of storage volume in the power reservoirs; a set of rules for releases from that storage; an agreement by the major irrigation districts with the largest water licenses to utilize their ability to shift deliveries to and from their large offstream storage reservoirs to allow for increased instream flows, and to allow junior water license holders (mainly municipal and industrial supplies) an uninterrupted water supply; limitations of reservoir fluctuations to improve inreservoir habitat for fisheries; and increased minimum flows throughout the system leading to improved environmental outcomes. Costs of this strategy were minimal, impacts on power revenue were estimated at <US$2 million/yr on average.

Statistical analysis indicates that conservation tillage has the highest score (0.25-0.36) in most replications, and its overlap with the second-best alternative is statistically negligible. Constructed wetlands technology, along with fertilizer and pesticide management, are mostly found as the second- and third-best alternatives, with scores ranging from 0.18 to 0.28 and 0.17 to 0.25, respectively.

This article carefully studies the effects of US agricultural policies on prices and quantities of 10 agricultural commodities and nine food categories in the United States over time. Using a detailed multimarket model, we simulate the counterfactual removal of measures of support applied to US agricultural commodities in 1992, 1997, and 2002 and quantify the effects on US food consumption and caloric intake. To parameterize the simulations, we calculate three alternative measures of consumer support (the implicit consumer subsidy from policies that support producers) for the 10 agricultural commodities using information about government expenditures on agricultural commodities from various sources. Our results indicate that - holding all other policies constant - removing US subsidies on grains and oilseeds in the three periods would have caused caloric consumption to decrease minimally whereas removal of all US agricultural policies (including barriers against imports of sugar and dairy products) would have caused total caloric intake to increase. Our results also indicate that the influence of agricultural policies on caloric intake has diminished over time.

First, we aim to clarify the mechanism by which use of farm machinery in Chinese agriculture has grown rapidly over the past decades, using a separate Cobb-Douglas (SCD) production function. Second, we determine under what condition will China's grain self-sufficiency be secured in the next decade. Our empirical results reveal that the supply and factor demand functions based on the SCD form can significantly explain the reality, in particular, the capital demand function. This finding suggests that the recent capital deepening in Chinese agriculture is caused by farmers' behavior in response to the government's directives aimed at securing arable land. Our simulation analysis reveals that the attainment of a 95% self-sufficiency rate would be quite challenging for China, unless the terms of trade in agriculture improve substantially in favor of producers. China's policy makers must therefore seriously reconsider whether adhering to the policy goal of grain self-sufficiency is worth the effort. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Capital deepening; China; Grain self-sufficiency; Production function",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871605724

Based on detrended data, variance decomposition was applied to assess how output prices and yields contributed to revenue risk over 3 different periods: the whole period (1990-2009), the first decade (1990-1999), and the second decade (1999-2009). In addition, the effect of expected changes in animal-based support for roughage-consuming cattle and price volatility on revenue risk was evaluated using a simulation model. Prices were the main contributor to revenue risk, even if the importance of yield risk increased over time. Swiss dairy producers can profit from natural hedge but market deregulation and market liberalization have reduced the natural hedge at the farm level. An increase in price volatility would substantially increase revenue risk and would, together with the abandonment of direct payments, reduce the comparative advantage of dairy production for risk-averse decision makers. Depending on other available risk management strategies, price risk management instruments might be a valuable solution for Swiss dairy producers in the future. © 2013 American Dairy Science Association.","Agriculture policy reform; Dairy farming; Revenue risk; Variance decomposition","animal; article; cattle; commercial phenomena; dairying; economics; female; income; milk; organization and management; policy; risk; statistics; Switzerland; Animals; Cattle; Commerce; Dairying; Female; Income; Milk; Public Policy; Risk; Switzerland; Animalia; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872677552

The topic of the paper is justified by the fact that most water authorities worldwide do not control water uses at the farm scale. The study draws inspiration from the pricing policies of a Reclamation and Irrigation Board in Northern Italy. It analyses the optimal design of current tariff strategies with respect both to the actual regulator's goals and the cost recovery objective of an ideal regulator driven by European Water Framework Directive principles and having full information. The analysis is based on the logic of a Principal-Agent model implemented as a mathematical non-linear programming model. Given the current pricing structure and assuming zero transaction costs, the results show a relevant increase in net benefits for the ideal scenario with respect to the actual one as water use costs increase. Benefits differences between the two scenarios mark a limit in value below which mechanisms able to solve the existing asymmetries between the principal and the agents are economically desirable. The study concludes by showing that the current regulator's discriminatory strategy (pricing structure) would be better justified with higher levels of cost for water use. However, the existence of non-zero transaction costs related to the control of water uses points to the need for further research in order to analyze incentive mechanisms in the absence of water metering. © 2013 by the authors.","Asymmetric information; Economic analysis; Irrigation; Mathematical simulation; Pricing schemes; Unmetered water; Water framework directive","Costs; Depreciation; Economic analysis; Environmental regulations; Irrigation; Water conservation; Water resources; Water supply; Agricultural water; Asymmetric information; European Water Framework Directive; Incentive mechanism; Mathematical simulations; Pricing scheme; Principal-agent model; Water Framework Directives; Cost benefit analysis; economic analysis; incentive; nonlinearity; pricing policy; tariff structure; water planning; water use; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84888800097

Decision support tools can help governments to identify future water supply problems in order to plan mitigation measures. Treated wastewater is considered a suitable alternative water resource and it is used for non-potable applications in many dry regions around the world. This work describes a decision support system (DSS) that was developed to identify current water reuse potential and the variables that determine the reclamation level. The DSS uses fuzzy inference system (FIS) as a tool and multi-criteria decision making is the conceptual approach behind the DSS. It was observed that water reuse level seems to be related to environmental factors such as drought, water exploitation index, water use, population density and the wastewater treatment rate, among others. A dataset was built to analyze these features through water reuse potential with a FIS that considered 155 regions and 183 cities. Despite some inexact fit between the classification and simulation data for agricultural and urban water reuse potential it was found that the FIS was suitable to identify the water reuse trend. Information on the water reuse potential is important because it issues a warning about future water supply needs based on climate change scenarios, which helps to support decision making with a view to tackling water shortage. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Fuzzy logic; Potential water reuse; Water shortage","climate change; decision support system; demand-side management; environmental factor; fuzzy mathematics; population density; recycling; wastewater; water demand; water management; water resource; water supply; water treatment; article; climate change; decision making; decision support system; drought; environmental factor; fuzzy system; population density; simulation; urban area; waste water management; waste water recycling; water supply; agriculture; city; decision support system; environmental protection; factual database; fuzzy logic; irrigation (agriculture); Potential water reuse; recycling; waste water; Water shortage; water supply; Climate change; Fuzzy logic; Potential water reuse; Water shortage; Agricultural Irrigation; Agriculture; Cities; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Databases, Factual; Decision Support Techniques; Fuzzy Logic; Recycling; Waste Water; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880732390

User can simulate different policy scenarios for organic farming and for assessing their impact on the economic and environmental parameters of organic production at aggregate level. After performing several simulation scenarios we discovered that conversion to organic farming relies on subsidies which provide the main motivation for conversion from conventional farming to organic farming. However, the subsidies are not the only driving force in the system, even more important are activities that promote organic farming, since sufficiently large subsidies could not be provided in order to complete the conversion from conventional to organic farming to the extent desired. Another important feature is food demand, determined by population size, which negatively influences the conversion to organic farming due to the increased demand leading to increased food prices. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Model; Organic farming; Simulation; System dynamics","Computer simulation; Models; Population statistics; System theory; Development scenarios; Environmental parameter; Government decisions; Organic farming; Simulation; Simulation scenarios; System Dynamics; System dynamics model; Agriculture; agricultural development; agricultural policy; decision making; demand analysis; economic impact; environmental impact; food production; numerical model; organic farming; policy analysis; population size; price dynamics; state role; subsidy system; Slovenia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879185398

This contribution analyses and discusses users' perceptions on re-use of urine as fertilizer through the lenses of the Receptivity model. A search was performed on Scopus (as well as other web search engines) using the keywords: urine, nutrient recovery and sanitation. Results shows how questions related to awareness, association, acquisition and application of the environmental change can represent hurdles to novel models of nutrient recovery and the use of urine in agriculture. Examples of hurdles identified from the literature relate to poor understanding of potential for urine reuse, social stigma attached to using dry sanitation and applying urine in agriculture and poor operational knowledge of application of urine in agriculture. Conclusion relates to the illustration of implications of such challenges on the design of environmental interventions. © 2013 The Author(s).","developing countries; fertilizers; Receptivity; urine reuse; user perceptions; Waste management","Agriculture; Developing countries; Fertilizers; Nutrients; Pipe flow; Population statistics; Recovery; Search engines; Waste management; Contribution analysis; Environmental change; Environmental practices; Operational knowledge; Population growth; Receptivity; urine reuse; User perceptions; Body fluids; fertilizer; climate change; developing world; fertilizer; nutrient use; perception; population growth; resource use; sanitation; urine; waste management; adaptive environmental management; agriculture; association; awareness; environmental change; environmental protection; environmental sanitation; nutrient management; perception; priority journal; recycling; review; simulation; social stigma; urine; agriculture; biological model; urinalysis; Scopus; Agriculture; Awareness; Models, Biological; Urinalysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878321523

However, many small-scale UPA systems are characterised by excessive nutrient inputs to the livestock unit and poor handling of manure. To assess the impact of improved feeding and manure management on nutrient use efficiency within the cattle unit, simulation modelling was used to compare three typical UPA farm types in Niamey, Niger, that comprised: animal husbandry alone (AH), animal husbandry plus gardening (AH+G), and animal husbandry plus gardening plus millet cultivation (AH+G+M). Improved feeding increased annual body weight gain and milk offtake from cattle and reduced the amount of nitrogen (N) excreted in urine, thereby lowering the risk of N emissions. With improved manure management, dry matter (DM) and nutrients recycled per animal and year, and potentially available for cropping, ranged from 321-690. kg. DM, 8-22. kg. N, 1.2-2.5. kg phosphorus (P), and 3.0-5.6. kg potassium (K) in AH as well as AH+G+M farms compared to 221-479. kg. DM, 5.0-14.0. kg. N, 0.7-1.6. kg. P, and 2.0-4.0. kg. K in AH+G farms. These amounts were up to 2.2-, 2.5-, 1.9- and 1-fold higher than the quantities of DM, N, P and K recycled under current practices. Feeding dairy cattle according to their requirements will enhance milk and meat production; if coupled with regular manure collection and low-cost covering of manure heaps, substantial amounts of nutrients are recycled to cropland and vegetable gardens and environmental pollution is reduced. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Cattle husbandry; Feeding management; Livestock simulator; Urban agriculture","agricultural modeling; animal husbandry; body mass; cattle; dry matter; food supplementation; livestock farming; manure; meat; milk production; numerical model; nutrient use efficiency; nutritional requirement; periurban area; phosphorus; potassium; recycling; urban agriculture; Niamey [Niger]; Niger [West Africa]; West Africa; Animalia; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867031025

Alternative scenarios help trace REDD+'s causal chain, revealing how trade-offs between the program's public and private costs and benefits determine its effectiveness, efficiency and equity (the 3Es). Scenarios reveal a complex relationship between the 3Es not evident in more aggregate analyses. Setting aside land as a carbon sink always influences the productivity of agriculture and its supply of non-market goods and services; but the overall returns to land and labor-which ultimately determine the opportunity cost of enrollment, the price of carbon and the distribution of gains and losses-depend on local conditions. In the study area, market-oriented landowners could enroll 30% of local land into a cost-effective program, but local subsistence demands would raise their opportunity costs as REDD+ unfurls, increasing the marginal cost of carbon. A combination of rent and wage changes would create net costs for most private stakeholders, including program participants. Increasing carbon prices undermines the program's efficiency without solving its inequities; expanding the program reduces inefficiencies but increases private costs with only minor improvements in equity. A program that prevents job losses could be the best option, but its efficiency compared to direct compensation could depend on program scale. Overall, neither the cost nor the 3Es of alternative REDD+ programs can be assessed without accounting for local demand for subsistence goods and services. In the context of Mexico's tropical highlands, a moderate-sized REDD+ program could at best have no net impact on rural households. REDD+ mechanisms should avoid general formulas by giving local authorities the necessary flexibility to address the trade-offs involved. National programs themselves should remain flexible enough to adjust for spatially and temporally changing contexts. © 2012 Dyer et al.",,"agricultural procedures; article; carbon footprint; carbon sink; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; deforestation; economic evaluation; environmental impact assessment; forest degradation; household; job market; land use; Mexico; outcome assessment; productivity; salary; simulation; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Natural Resources; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Developing Countries; Environmental Policy; Global Warming; Humans; Models, Statistical; Salaries and Fringe Benefits; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871587137

However, the omission of transaction costs from policy evaluations and decision-making processes may result in inefficiency in public resource allocation and sub-optimal policy choices and outcomes. This paper aims to assess the relative cost-effectiveness of market-based GHG mitigation policy instruments in the agricultural sector by incorporating transaction costs. Assuming that farmers' responses to mitigation policies are economically rationale, an individual-based model is developed to study the relative performances of an emission tax, a nitrogen fertilizer tax, and a carbon trading scheme using farm data from the Scottish farm account survey (FAS) and emissions and transaction cost data from literature metadata survey. Model simulations show that none of the three schemes could be considered the most cost effective in all circumstances.

The Canadian WEBs project (Watershed Evaluation of Beneficial Management Practices, BMPs) was launched to evaluate the environmental and economic performance of BMPs as a means to mitigate agricultural sediment and nutrient issues. In this paper, the Gestion Intégrée des Bassins versant à l'aide d'un Système Informa-tisé (GIBSI) (or Integrated Watershed Management using a Computer System) integrated modeling framework was used to evaluate the effects of different BMPs on sediment and nutrient yields, as well as water quality in the Beaurivage River watershed in the province of Quebec. A reference scenario was developed that describes the current situation (i.e., base case scenario) of the watershed by calibrating the models used within GIBSI, namely HYDROTEL for hydrology, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) for soil erosion, the Erosion-the Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for contaminant transport and fate, and QUAL2E for stream water quality. The effects of four BMPs were studied: (1) vegetated riparian buffer strips, (2) precision slurry application, (3) grassland conversion of cereal and corn fields, and (4) no-till (on corn fields). Simulation results indicate that BMPs can be effective in reducing nutrient and suspended sediment loads in both surface runoff and stream flow. More specifically, buffer strip and crop rotation showed better efficiency than hog-slurry management and no-till on corn BMPs. Moreover, results highlight the need for further investigation of sediment dynamics in the stream network as well as in the riparian buffer strips. © 2013 Canadian Water Resources Association.",,"Environmental and economic performance; Integrated modeling framework; Integrated watershed management; Revised universal soil loss equations; Riparian buffer strips; Soil and water assessment tool; Suspended sediment loads; Watershed evaluation of beneficial management practices; Agriculture; Erosion; Sediment transport; Soil conservation; Soil pollution; Stream flow; Surface waters; Water conservation; Water management; Water pollution; Water quality; Watersheds; Nutrients",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880935787

Subject and method The study used a modified input-output framework based on the Canadian input-output data for the year 2004 to capture the impact on the whole economy due to changes in food consumption. The input-output method is one of the most widely applied methods in economics. The input-output framework analyzes the interdependence of industries in an economy. The basic information fromwhich this framework is developed is contained in an input-output table. The rows of such a table describe the distribution of a producer's output throughout the economy. The columns of the table, on the other hand, describe the composition of inputs required by a particular industry to produce its output. Final demand indicates the sales by each sector to final markets for their production, such as household consumption purchases, sales to the government, and exports to the other countries. This method requires that a sector uses inputs in fixed proportions. The modified Input-Output table of Canada consists of a detailed agricultural sector provided by Agriculture and Agri-food Canada (AAFC). Several simulation exercises have been carried out combining different food consumption strategies. Results The study reveals a gap between the actual and recommended consumption of a healthy diet in Canada for 2004. Canada's Food Guide for a healthy diet includes four categories of food items: vegetables and fruits, grain products, milk and alternatives, and meat and alternatives. Results show that the Canadian diet has more meat and less vegetables, fruits, milk, and whole grains than recommended. Findings on the implications of a number of strategies combining different food consumptions reveal diverse results. An increase in GDP and employment can be expected if the Canadian diet is composed of more vegetables and fruits, while a reduction in employment and GDP may occur from more meat consumption. The combined strategy with four categories of food items would generate more jobs and GDP in Canada. Conclusion The article suggests that a suitable portfolio of fiscal policies is needed to provide households with incentives to change their food consumption patterns towards a healthy diet. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","Canada; Fruits and vegetables; Healthy diet; Household consumption; Meat","agriculture; article; Canada; diet; economic aspect; food industry; food intake; fruit; government; grain; gross national product; health care policy; household; human; meat; milk; vegetable",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871279033

The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) was applied to simulate NPS pollution and the Fragstats model was applied to calculate the landscape metrics. The study concluded that organic nutrients formed the main NPS pollutant in the DJKR basin and that most of the NPS pollution occurred along with soil loss. Based on partial redundancy analysis, the conclusion that landscape metrics were significantly correlated to NPS pollution indices was obtained. Specifically, the composition of LULC (land use/land cover) was the most effective factor to estimate NPS pollution. Dry cultivated land was identified as the main source of NPS pollution, and paddy fields were characterized with the most intensive soluble nutrients loss. In addition, the reason that fragmented and complex landscape patterns exacerbate NPS pollution was that natural landscape composed most of this area. Moreover, the fragmented natural landscape indicated intensive agricultural activities that were the crucial trigger for NPS pollution.

Simulation results suggest that the broad-based GHG policies in general have lower efficiency costs and result in less re-distributive effects. BTAs bring modest efficiency gains with adverse distributional consequences. The distributional impacts are smaller under broad-based GHG policies compared to that based on CO2 only. However, these are due to a wider variety of abatement options under multi-gas policies rather than the BTAs per se. The main difference between the two policies is distributional effects. First, CO2-only based policies have worse impacts on fossil fuel exporters such as Russia and relatively better outcomes for oil importers such as India and China, compared to that of multi-gas policies particularly when it involves large global emission reduction. Second, sectoral coverage under BTAs also influences the differential outcomes. For example, Brazil is worse impacted under GHG-based policies if agriculture is brought under BTAs as two-third of its emissions are non-CO2 based and agriculture is the primary source of these emissions. © 2012.","Border tax adjustments (BTAs); Carbon leakage; Competitiveness","Border tax adjustments; Carbon leakage; Climate policy; Competitiveness; Computable general equilibrium model; Efficiency gain; GHG emission; Global emissions; Leakage effects; Primary sources; Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Competition; Efficiency; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; adjustment mechanism; carbon dioxide; competitiveness; computable general equilibrium analysis; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental policy; fossil fuel; pollution tax; Brazil; China; India; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870059165

The model, simulating water resources deriving from numerous catchment sources and demand from four sectors (domestic, industrial, agricultural, external pumping), contains multiple feedback loops and sub-models. The SDM is applied to the Merguellil catchment, Tunisia; the first time such an integrated model has been developed for the water scarce Kairouan region. The application represents an early step in filling a critical research gap. The focus of this paper is to a) assess the applicability of SDM for assessment of the evolution of a water-scarce catchment and b) to analyse the current and future behaviour of the catchment to evaluate water scarcity, focusing on understanding trends to inform policy. Baseline results indicate aquifer over-exploitation, agreeing with observed trends. If current policy and social behaviour continue, serious aquifer depletion is possible in the not too distant future, with implications for the economy and environment. This is unlikely to occur because policies preventing depletion will be implemented. Sensitivity tests were carried out to show which parameters most impacted aquifer behaviour. Results show non-linear model behaviour. Some tests showed negligible change in behaviour. Others showed unrealistic exponential changes in demand, revenue and aquifer water volume. Policy-realistic parameters giving the greatest positive impact on model behaviour were those controlling per-capita domestic water demand and the pumped volume to coastal cities. All potentially beneficial policy options should be considered, giving the best opportunity for preservation of Kairouan aquifer water quantity/quality, ecologically important habitats and the agricultural socio-economic driver of regional development.

Green Water Credits (GWC) schemes are being developed to encourage upstream farmers to invest in soil and water conservation practices which will positively effect upstream and downstream water availability. Quantitative information on water and sediment fluxes is crucial as a basis for such financial schemes. A pilot design project in the large and strategically important Upper-Tana Basin in Kenya has the objective to develop a methodological framework for this purpose. The essence of the methodology is the integration and use of a collection of public domain tools and datasets: the so-called Green water and Blue water Assessment Toolkit (GBAT). This toolkit was applied in order to study different options to implement GWC in agricultural rainfed land for the pilot study. Impact of vegetative contour strips, mulching, and tied ridges were determined for: (i) three upstream key indicators: soil loss, crop transpiration and soil evaporation, and (ii) two downstream indicators: sediment inflow in reservoirs and groundwater recharge. All effects were compared with a baseline scenario of average conditions. Thus, not only actual land management was considered but also potential benefits of changed land use practices. Results of the simulations indicate that especially applying contour strips or tied ridges significantly reduces soil losses and increases groundwater recharge in the catchment. The model was used to build spatial expressions of the proposed management practices in order to assess their effectiveness. The developed procedure allows exploring the effects of soil conservation measures in a catchment to support the implementation of GWC. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Basin modelling; Decision support tool; Kenya; Soil erosion; Water conservation; Watershed management","ground water; basin management; crop yield; decision support system; land management; land use; policy making; quantitative analysis; soil conservation; water availability; water management; watershed; agricultural land; article; catchment; crop; environmental impact; environmental parameters; environmental planning; environmental protection; evaporation; evapotranspiration; experimental model; hydrological model; Kenya; pilot study; quantitative analysis; reservoir; sediment; soil conservation; soil loss; water conservation; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Consumer Participation; Environmental Pollution; Kenya; Models, Theoretical; Pilot Projects; Policy Making; Rivers; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865345915

On the one hand, such optimization methods can enhance performances of commonly targeted objectives (such as hydropower production or water supply), on the other hand they risk strongly penalizing all the interests not directly (i.e. mathematically) included in the optimization algorithm. The alteration of the downstream hydrological regime is a well established cause of ecological degradation and its evaluation and rehabilitation is commonly required by recent legislation (as the Water Framework Directive in Europe). However, it is rarely embedded in reservoir optimization routines and, even when explicitly considered, the criteria adopted for its evaluation are doubted and not commonly trusted, undermining the possibility of real implementation of environmentally friendly policies. The main challenges in defining and assessing hydrological alterations are: how to define a reference state (referencing); how to define criteria upon which to build mathematical indicators of alteration (measuring); and finally how to aggregate the indicators in a single evaluation index (valuing) that can serve as objective function in the optimization problem. This paper aims to address these issues by: (i) discussing the benefits and constrains of different approaches to referencing, measuring and valuing hydrological alteration; (ii) testing two alternative indices of hydrological alteration, one based on the established framework of Indicators of Hydrological Alteration (Richter et al., 1996), and one satisfying the mathematical properties required by widely used optimization methods based on dynamic programming; (iii) demonstrating and discussing these indices by application River Ticino, in Italy; (iv) providing a framework to effectively include hydrological alteration within reservoir operation optimization. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Ecohydrology; Hydrological alteration; Multi-objective optimization; Reservoir operation","Computing power; Eco-hydrology; Environmentally-friendly; Evaluation index; Flood risks; Human activities; Hydro power production; Hydrological alteration; Hydrological regime; ITS evaluation; Mathematical properties; Multi objective; Multi objective optimizations (MOO); Multi-objective optimization techniques; Objective functions; Operating policies; Optimization algorithms; Optimization method; Optimization problems; Optimization routine; Pareto-optimal; Reference state; Reservoir operation; Water Framework Directives; Water resources management; Algorithms; Environmental regulations; Functions; Laws and legislation; Multiobjective optimization; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Reservoirs (water); algorithm; computer simulation; dam; ecohydrology; environmental policy; flood; human activity; hydroelectric power; hydrological change; hydrological regime; optimization; power generation; regulatory framework; reservoir impoundment; risk assessment; water management; water resource; water supply; Italy; Ticino River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868301292

Seed from improved varieties and other inputs are imperative to the transformation of the agricultural sector from subsistence farming to small-scale commercial agriculture and thus to increasing food security on the continent. Farmers make the decision to adopt seed from improved varieties based on a number of seed attributes. These range from tangible attributes such as input costs and yield to intangible attributes such as trust in seed from improved varieties. In the course of adoption decisions, social dynamics involving trust can over-ride objective evaluations of tangible attributes. This makes it difficult to design sustainable adoption policies in an intuitive way. For this purpose, we develop a system dynamics model and combine it with conjoint analysis. Conjoint analysis allows us to elicit smallholder farmers' choice preferences in detail and to add precision to the structure of the model. The simulation framework helps to improve our understanding concerning the dynamic implications of accumulation processes relating to trust and skill. We test this approach with empirical data for maize in Malawi. Model simulations demonstrate that effective adoption stimulation policies should focus on measures that build trust in improved maize varieties instead of increasing their potential yield even further and, in this way, contribute to food security. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Food security; Innovation adoption and diffusion; Policy analysis; System dynamics","Agricultural sector; Food security; Innovation adoption; Objective evaluation; Policy analysis; Simulation framework; System Dynamics; System dynamics model; Agriculture; Computer simulation; Food supply; Statistical methods; System theory; Seed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870006153

Because soils can contribute significantly to P loss in runoff, it is important to assess how management affects soil P status over time, which is oft en done with models. Our objective was to describe and validate soil P dynamics in the Annual P Loss Estimator (APLE) model. APLE is a user-friendly spreadsheet model that simulates P loss in runoffand soil P dynamics over 10 yr for a given set of runoff, erosion, and management conditions. For soil P dynamics, APLE simulates two layers in the topsoil, each with three inorganic P pools and one organic P pool. It simulates P additions to soil from manure and fertilizer, distribution among pools, mixing between layers due to tillage and bioturbation, leaching between and out of layers, crop P removal, and loss by surface runoffand erosion. We used soil P data from 25 published studies to validate APLE's soil P processes. Our results show that APLE reliably simulated soil P dynamics for a wide range of soil properties, soil depths, P application sources and rates, durations, soil P contents, and management practices. We validated APLE specifically for situations where soil P was increasing from excessive P inputs, where soil P was decreasing due to greater outputs than inputs, and where soil P stratification occurred in no-till and pasture soils. Successful simulations demonstrate APLE's potential to be applied to major management scenarios related to soil P loss in runoffand erosion. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.",,"Bioturbation; Fresh Water; Management practices; Management scenarios; No-till; P removal; Pasture soils; Phosphorus loss; Soil depth; Soil phosphorus; Soil property; Spreadsheet models; Agriculture; Dynamics; Erosion; Lakes; Leaching; Manures; Phosphorus; Runoff; Soils; Water pollution; Water quality; Geologic models; fertilizer; phosphorus; annual phosphorus loss estimator model; article; limit of quantitation; manure; model; soil analysis; soil erosion; soil management; soil property; Computer Simulation; Geological Processes; Models, Theoretical; Phosphorus; Reproducibility of Results; Soil; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869470110

Specifically, I merge the unified growth models of Galor and Weil [American Economic Review 90 (2000), 806-828] and Hansen and Prescott [American Economic Review 92 (2002), 1205-1217] to capture the importance of human capital formation, fertility decline, and the transition from agriculture to industry in transition from stagnation to growth. Moreover, I also incorporate young adult mortality into the model. Initially, the aggregate human capital and return to education are low and the mortality rate is high; therefore parents invest in quantity of children. Once sufficient human capital is accumulated and mortality rates are reduced, thanks to increasing life expectancy, with the activation of the modern human capital-intensive sector, parents start to invest in the quality of their children. The simulation of the model economy improves upon the quantitative performance of the existing literature and successfully captures the evolution of fertility, population, and GDP in the British economy between 1750 and 2000.

Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) was applied to estimate the uncertainties in methane emissions and the methane emission intensities from livestock in Canada, calculated using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology. National methane emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management in 2008 were 212 and 43 Teragram CO2 equivalents (Tg CO2e) with uncertainties of 38 and 73%, respectively. The methane emission intensities (kg of CO 2e per kg of live animal weight) were 59, 09 and 49 from Canadian beef, swine and lamb, respectively, with overall uncertainties of 44, 99 and 101%, defined as the 95% confidence interval relative to the mean. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that IPCC default parameters such as the methane conversion rate (Y m), the coefficient for calculating net energy for maintenance (Cfi) and the methane conversion factor (MCF) were the greatest sources of uncertainty. Canadian agricultural methane emissions are usually calculated by province and by animal subcategories. However, the IPCC default parameters can be assumed to be correlated among regions and animal subcategories; therefore values are assigned at the national scale for the main cattle categories (dairy and non-dairy cattle). When it was assumed that these parameters were uncorrelated at the regional scale, the overall uncertainties were reduced to 20 and 48% for enteric fermentation and manure management, respectively, and assuming that parameters were uncorrelated at the animal subcategory scale reduced uncertainties to 13 and 41% for enteric fermentation and manure management, respectively. When the uncertainty is assigned at the most disaggregated level, even doubling the uncertainty of key parameters such as Y m and Cfi, only increased the national uncertainties to 22 and 52% for enteric fermentation and manure management, respectively. The current analysis demonstrated the importance of obtaining parameters specific to regions and animal subcategories in order to estimate GHG emissions more accurately and to reduce the uncertainties in agricultural GHG inventories. It also showed that assumptions made in the calculation of uncertainties can have a large influence on the uncertainty estimates. © Her Majesty theQueen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Agriculture and Agr-Food Canada, 2011.",,"agricultural emission; anthropogenic source; biogenic emission; carbon dioxide; digestive system; emission inventory; fermentation; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; livestock; manure; methane; Monte Carlo analysis; parameterization; pollutant source; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty analysis; Canada; Animalia; Bos; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865528135

To devise such strategies, we focused on a well-defined, previously studied brown bear population living in the Oshima Peninsula region of Hokkaido, and constructed a population dynamics model for adult females. The model construction was based on the ecological and physiological characteristics of the Oshima Peninsula population, with particular emphasis on bear behavior (levels of aggressiveness and intrusiveness) and human-bear interactions (bear kills, food conditioning, and aversive conditioning). To predict the future population dynamics, we ran stochastic simulations over a period of 100. years. We used the simulation outputs to estimate the risk of management failure under four plausible scenarios, including the scenario that represents the present management practices. The results of the analysis indicated that the present management practices could not satisfactorily resolve the problem of increasing agricultural damage. However, an adaptive management strategy successfully reduced the risk of management failure to a negligible level. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Aversive conditioning; Ecological risk; Food conditioning; Human-bear conflict; Nuisance bear; Population dynamics model; Ursus arctos","Ecological risks; Human-bear conflict; Nuisance bear; Population dynamics models; Ursus arctos; Agriculture; Ecology; Physiological models; Population dynamics; Stochastic models; Risk perception; adaptive management; adult; aggression; agricultural practice; bear; conditioning; food availability; management practice; nature-society relations; physiology; population dynamics; population modeling; risk assessment; species conservation; Hokkaido; Japan; Oshima Peninsula; Ursus arctos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863464633

This result is mainly due to the poor productivity of field cultivation relative to timber production under boreal climate conditions. In addition to soil quality, the initial stand structure affects the costs of both biodiversity zone types. It is less costly for a landowner to establish biodiversity zones in forests where no final felling is imminent but which already contain some tree volume. In field biodiversity zones, costs are slightly lower on fields where forest shading is great. Uneven-aged management practiced in forest biodiversity zones was found to lead to a 3-32% reduction in the net present value of forest land compared to conventional forest management.

The case study involves a set of agricultural commodities in south eastern Australia and the program uses estimates of each grid cell's soil suitability for each of the eight crops, both in the year 2000 and in the year 2050, by which time soil characteristics are expected to have been affected by environmental change. We first predict how much total regional production will result from a judicious re-location of commodity types, both under conditions of complete flexibility and when constrained by more realistic, upper and lower limits on production, and we compare such predictions with current production levels. We also estimate potential total regional revenue, both in the short term when current prices are assumed to remain static and in the long term when prices are assumed to change according to how much of each commodity is produced compared to its current output level, and we compare these results with current agricultural revenue. Our long-term estimates are based on year 2000 soil-suitability values and then on year 2050 soil-suitability values in order to gauge the probable impacts of environmental change.

These issues will force major changes to physical and managerial aspects as well as the design of water delivery and on-farm irrigation systems. Thus, a water- and energy-limited future will be the likely catalyst that finally brings many of the existing precision agricultural technologies together for irrigated agriculture. Resource conservation as well as achieving environmental benefits will probably require the adoption of non-uniform water applications, also known as site-specific irrigation, for many growers. The goal of site-specific irrigation is to conserve water by directing the amount and frequency of water applications according to established spatial and temporal crop water requirements. However, more than 20 years of private and public research on site-specific irrigation has resulted in very limited commercial adoption of the technology. The current state of the art of site-specific center-pivot and linear-move sprinkler irrigation is reviewed. Several general barriers to adoption of the technology and various knowledge gaps are identified. The primary reason for the very low rate of commercial adoption appears to be the absence of a market for the technology and a low rate of return. Documented and proven water conservation strategies using site-specific sprinkler irrigation for crop production are quite limited, and its cost-effectiveness has not been demonstrated. Simulation studies comparing conventional and site-specific irrigation have reported water savings of 0% to 26% for well-watered crop production, and the greatest savings are most likely to occur in humid climates by spatially maximizing utilization of non-uniform growing season precipitation. In arid and semi-arid climates, the greatest potential water savings could come from highly managed deficit irrigation strategies in which spatial management of soil water deficit timing is used to maximize net return rather than yield. Future research needs to focus on developing and documenting cost-effective site-specific water conservation strategies to support market development for these advanced and needed irrigation technologies. © 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Adaptive control systems; Decision support; Irrigation controls; Precision agriculture; Precision irrigation; Sensor systems; Spatial variability; Water management","Decision supports; Precision Agriculture; Precision irrigation; Sensor systems; Spatial variability; Adaptive control systems; Cost effectiveness; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Earnings; Natural resources; Technology; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Sprinkler systems (irrigation); agricultural technology; arid region; commercial activity; control system; cost-benefit analysis; crop production; decision support system; irrigation system; market development; precision agriculture; semiarid region; sensor; spatial variation; water availability; water economics; water management; water planning; water supply; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861639820

Such economic impacts can be evaluated using the input-output analysis developed by Leontief. In this paper, two scenario earthquakes in northern Taiwan both with a return period of 475 years-the Hsinchu Hsincheng and the Yilan Nan-ao earthquakes-are simulated. The results show that the economic impact caused by the Hsincheng earthquake is greater than that resulting from the Nan-ao earthquake, which should be the major scenario considered for the disaster reduction plan. The industries affected the most are the manufacturing, food services and entertainment, storage and retail trade, and public and construction industries. The Nan-ao earthquake causes relatively more losses in the food services and entertainment industries. Most of the repercussion effects of these industries are in the central and southern parts of Taiwan. The loss to the manufacturing sector and its repercussion effects are enormous. Therefore, the government should make it a first priority to encourage the manufacturing sector to implement earthquake mitigations, such as a seismic retrofit, or to provide a seismic evaluation, which can enable firms to engage in mitigation voluntarily. The measure needed to reduce the loss in agriculture is that the government can purchase agricultural products in central and southern Taiwan following the disaster and offer them to survivors in northern Taiwan. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Multi-regional input-output table; Regional economic impact; Scenario earthquake; Seismic retrofit; TELES","computer simulation; disaster management; earthquake; economic impact; industrial development; input-output analysis; regional economy; regional planning; seismicity; service sector; state role; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856398421

The objective of this study is to develop a modeling system that links global climate models with regional hydrologic models, using the California Central Valley as a case study. The new method is a supply and demand modeling framework that can be used to simulate and analyze potential climate change and conjunctive use. Supply-constrained and demand-driven linkages in the water system in the Central Valley are represented with the linked climate models, precipitation-runoff models, agricultural and native vegetation water use, and hydrologic flow models to demonstrate the feasibility of this method. Simulated precipitation and temperature were used from the GFDL-A2 climate change scenario through the 21st century to drive a regional water balance mountain hydrologic watershed model (MHWM) for the surrounding watersheds in combination with a regional integrated hydrologic model of the Central Valley (CVHM). Application of this method demonstrates the potential transition from predominantly surface water to groundwater supply for agriculture with secondary effects that may limit this transition of conjunctive use. The particular scenario considered includes intermittent climatic droughts in the first half of the 21st century followed by severe persistent droughts in the second half of the 21st century. These climatic droughts do not yield a valley-wide operational drought but do cause reduced surface water deliveries and increased groundwater abstractions that may cause additional land subsidence, reduced water for riparian habitat, or changes in flows at the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.

The main objective of this study is to develop a multi-methodological approach that allows supporting decision makers to choose the alternative that achieves the best compromise solution in irrigated areas between a set of socio-economic and environmental attributes. To this end, a case study is applied in two irrigation districts in the province of Palencia (Spain). The proposed approach takes the following steps: (a) selection of potential alternatives to be evaluated, (b)classification of farmers into homogeneous groups, (c) simulation of irrigated farmers behaviour when facing different water pricing alternatives via positive mathematical programming models, (d) selection of the socioeconomic and environmental criteria for the analysis and (e) application of a hybrid multi-criteria decision making model to rank the alternatives integrating the Analytic Hierarchy Process and the modified Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. The results show the effectiveness and potential utility of the proposed methodological framework for irrigation water pricing instruments' selection. The empirical results of this research indicate that those pricing instruments which consider the current consumption of irrigation water allow for a better compromise solution instead of the tools that price water irrespective of current consumption. Furthermore, the results also suggest that the irrigation water pricing policy could be implemented in function of the different farming districts, rather than establishing one single type of irrigation water pricing instrument and tariff level for a whole river basin, as these would not allow to achieve the same degree of compromise solution in different farming-districts. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","AHP; Compromise solution; Irrigated agriculture; PMP; TOPSIS","AHP; Compromise solution; Irrigated agriculture; PMP; TOPSIS; C (programming language); Computer programming; Computer simulation; Costs; Decision making; Economics; Instruments; Mathematical programming; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Irrigation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855198526

This review will largely highlight approaches and progress made in the last five years to address strategies to reduce pathogen contamination in animal production but will also touch on the emerging field of preharvest produce food safety. Mitigation strategies can be divided into those that address pathogen reduction in the environment and those that target reduction/elimination of pathogen contamination in animals or plants. The former strategy has been encompassed in studies evaluating sanitation treatments of facilities as well as in numerous epidemiologic risk assessment studies (both on-farm assessments and computer simulation models) that identify management practices that impact pathogen prevalence in animals. Interventions to significantly reduce pathogen exposure via feed or water are dependent on their role as a significant contributor to pathogen contamination in the animal production system. In addition, inconsistent results obtained with interventions of dietary additives or formulation modifications (grain versus forage; inclusion of distiller's grains) on pathogen prevalence in animals have been attributed to a range of factors including target organism, grain type, level of inclusion, the animal's health or stress level, and ability to survive the gastric acidic conditions. Recent attempts to microencapsulate organic acids or bacteriophage within feed have met with only marginal improvements in reducing pathogen carriage in animals but this approach may have greater potential with other antimicrobial additives (i.e., essential oils). Bacteriophage therapy, in general, can significantly reduce pathogen carriage in animals but based on its transient nature and the potential for development of phage-resistant subpopulations, this approach should be administered to animals just prior to slaughter and preferably to animals that are suspected ""super-shedders"". Other promising on-farm intervention approaches have included breeding for pathogen resistance, vaccines, and dietary bacteriocins. To optimize interventions on a cost basis, studies have also determined that application of dietary interventions at specific time points in the animal's production cycle is a useful strategy to reduce pathogen carriage (e.g., probiotics to fertilized eggs and acidified feed to fattening swine). In conclusion, applicable management and intervention strategies may vary depending on the type of food under production; however, it is important to consider from a holistic view how any new intervention strategies will affect the overall production system in order to maintain a successful, efficient food production environment. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","On-farm interventions; Pathogen interventions; Preharvest interventions; Salmonella, E. coli O157:H7","bacteriocin; prebiotic agent; probiotic agent; synbiotic agent; vaccine; agriculture; animal food; animal health; animal product; antibiotic resistance; bacteriophage; computer simulation; cost benefit analysis; environmental sanitation; food contamination; food industry; food safety; forage; grain; immunotherapy; livestock; microbial contamination; nonhuman; pathogenesis; poultry; prevalence; review; risk assessment; simulation; stomach acid; swine; vaccination; water treatment; Animals; Escherichia coli Infections; Food Contamination; Fruit; Humans; Meat; Salmonella Infections; Vegetables; Animalia; Salmonella; Suidae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83655190539

On the plains in warm climatic areas, low-input orchards and arable crops dominate; in hilly and mountainous areas, mixed farms with forage crops, meadows, ovines, and cattle prevail.

As the global climate changes and food security becomes an increasingly important issue, agriculture drought comes to the focus of attention. China is a typical monsoon climate country as well as an agricultural country with the world's largest population. The East Asian monsoon has had a tremendous impact upon agricultural production. Therefore, a maize drought disaster risk assessment, in line with the requirements of sustainable development of agriculture, is important for ensuring drought disaster reduction and food security. Meteorology, soil, land use, and agro-meteorological observation information of the research area were collected, and based on the concept framework of 'hazard-inducing factors assessment (hazard)-vulnerability assessment of hazard-affected body (vulnerability curve)-risk assessment (risk),' importing crop model EPIC (Erosion-Productivity Impact Calculator), using crop model simulation and digital mapping techniques, quantitative assessment of spatio-temporal distribution of maize drought in China was done. The results showed that: in terms of 2, 5, 10, and 20 year return periods, the overall maize drought risk decreased gradually from northwest to southeast in the maize planting areas. With the 20 year return period, high risk value regions (drought loss rate ≥0.5) concentrate in the irrigated maize region of Northwest china, ecotone between agriculture and animal husbandry in Northern China, Hetao Irrigation Area, and north-central area of North China Plain, accounting for 6.41% of the total maize area.

The growing demand for biomass for energy production induces the cultivation of a few fast growing and high-yielding energy crops on vast areas of arable land. This land-use change has been found associated with the reduction of habitat suitability for farmland birds and a decline in farmland biodiversity in general. A large number of studies have assessed the ecological effects of energy crop cultivation at the local scale of a single field. This study focuses on regional landscape changes caused by increased energy crop cultivation, which includes reduction of crop-type richness and spatial concentration of single crop-types. We present a spatially explicit ecological model to assess the population-level consequences of these effects on the abundance of the farmland bird species Skylark (Alauda arvensis). We also investigate the impacts of different land-use scenarios and aim to identify adaptive conservation options. We show that (1) the impacts of increased energy crop cultivation on Skylark population abundance depend strongly on the landscape structure; (2) impacts could be tolerated as long as a certain minimum level of crop-type heterogeneity is retained at the landscape level and (3) conservation actions are required and effective especially on landscapes where crop-field size is large. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bioenergy; Biomass production; Ecological sustainability; Land-use change; Landscape structure; Regional scale; Simulation model; Skylark","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Biomass; Birds; Cultivation; Ecology; Farms; Forestry; Land use; Bio-energy; Biomass productions; Ecological sustainability; Land-use change; Landscape structures; Regional scale; Simulation model; Skylark; Crops",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867909121

We compare the performance of the EPA's mandatory refuges and a tax (or subsidy) on the pesticide variety under several biological assumptions on pest mobility and the heterogeneity of farmers' pest vulnerability. We find that only the tax (or subsidy) restores efficiency if pest mobility is perfect within the area. If pest mobility is imperfect and when farmers face identical pest vulnerability, only the refuge might restore efficiency. With simulations we illustrate that complex outcomes may arise for intermediate levels of pest mobility and farmers' heterogeneity. Our results shed light on the choice of regulatory instruments for common-pool resource regulations where spatial localization matters. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Externalities; Pest resistance; Pesticides; Refuge; Spatial; Tax; Transgenic crop","Agriculture; Efficiency; Pesticides; Restoration; Externalities; Pest resistance; Refuge; Spatial; Transgenic crops; Taxation; farmers attitude; heterogeneity; pest resistance; refuge; regulatory framework; subsidy system; transgenic plant; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82455209050
